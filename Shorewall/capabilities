# /etc/shorewall/capabilities
#
#	This file is used when compiling with the -e flag. It specifies
#	the capabilities of the kernel/iptables on the target system.
#	The capabilities are listed in the same order as they appear in
#	the output of "shorewall show capabilities". If the capability
#	is available, set the corresponding variable to "Yes". Otherwise
#	leave it empty.
#
# You may generate the contents of this file programatically using the
# 'shorecap' program included with your Shorewall distribution. If you
# installed using the RPM, the file will be in the Shorewall
# documentation directory. Otherwise, please find the program in the
# directory created when you expanded the Shorewall distribution tarball.
