# Shorewall version  3.0 - Proxyarp File
#
# /etc/shorewall/proxyarp
#
#	This file is used to define Proxy ARP.
#
# Columns are:
#
#	ADDRESS		IP Address
#
#	INTERFACE	Local interface where system is connected.
#
#	EXTERNAL	External Interface to be used to access this system
#
#	HAVEROUTE	If there is already a route from the firewall to
#			the host whose address is given, enter "Yes" or "yes"
#			in this column. Otherwise, entry "no", "No" or leave
#			the column empty and Shorewall will add the route for
#			you. If Shorewall adds the route,the route will be
#			persistent if the PERSISTENT column contains Yes;
#			otherwise, "shorewall stop" or "shorewall clear" will
#			delete the route.
#
#	PERSISTENT	If HAVEROUTE is No or "no", then the value of this
#			column determines if the route added by Shorewall
#			persists after a "shorewall stop" or a "shorewall
#			clear". If this column contains "Yes" or "yes" then
#			the route persists; If the column is empty or contains
#			"No"or "no" then the route is deleted at "shorewall
#			stop" or "shorewall clear".
#
#			Example: Host with IP 155.186.235.6 is connected to
#			interface eth1 and we want hosts attached via eth0
#			to be able to access it using that address.
#
#			#ADDRESS	INTERFACE	EXTERNAL
#			155.186.235.6	eth1		eth0
#
