# Shorewall version 3.2 - Providers File
#
# /etc/shorewall/providers
#
#	This file is used to define additional routing tables. You will
#	want to define an additional table if:
#
#	- You have connections to more than one ISP or multiple connections
#	  to the same ISP
#
#	- You run Squid as a transparent proxy on a host other than the
#	  firewall.
#
#	To omit a column, enter "-".
#
# Columns are:
#
#	NAME		The provider name.
#
#	NUMBER		The provider number -- a number between 1 and 15
#
#	MARK		A FWMARK value used in your /etc/shorewall/tcrules
#			file to direct packets to this provider.
#
#			If HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes in shorewall.conf, then the
#			value must between 0x0100 and 0xff00 and the
#			low-order byte of the value must be zero. Otherwise,
#			the value must be between 1 and 255.
#
#	DUPLICATE	The name of an existing table to duplicate. May be
#			'main' or the name of a previous provider.
#
#	INTERFACE	The name of the network interface to the provider.
#			Must be listed in /etc/shorewall/interfaces.
#
#	GATEWAY		The IP address of the provider's gateway router.
#
#			You can enter "detect" here and Shorewall will
#			attempt to detect the gateway automatically.
#
#	OPTIONS		A comma-separated list selected from the following:
#
#		track	If specified, connections FROM this interface are
#			to be tracked so that responses may be routed back
#			out this same interface.
#
#			You want specify 'track' if internet hosts will be
#			connecting to local servers through this provider.
#
#		balance The providers that have 'balance' specified will
#			get outbound traffic load-balanced among them. By
#			default, all interfaces with 'balance' specified
#			will have the same weight (1). You can change the
#			weight of an interface by specifiying balance=<weight>
#			where <weight> is the weight of the route out of
#			this interface.
#
#		loose	Normally, Shorewall adds routing rules to prohibit
#			firewall marks from working with traffic generated
#			on the firewall itself. By setting the 'loose'
#			option, generation of these rules is avoided.
#
#	COPY		A comma-separated lists of other interfaces on your
#			firewall. Only makes sense when DUPLICATE is 'main'.
#			Only copy routes through INTERFACE and through
#			interfaces listed here. If you only wish to copy
#			routes through INTERFACE, enter 'none' here.
#
# Example:  You run squid in your DMZ on IP address 192.168.2.99. Your DMZ
#	    interface is eth2
#
#	#NAME	NUMBER	MARK DUPLICATE	INTERFACE GATEWAY	OPTIONS
#	Squid	1	1    -		eth2	  192.168.2.99	-
#
# Example:
#
#      eth0 connects to ISP 1. The IP address of eth0 is 206.124.146.176 and
#      the ISP's gateway router has IP address 206.124.146.254.
#
#      eth1 connects to ISP 2. The IP address of eth1 is 130.252.99.27 and the
#      ISP's gateway router has IP address 130.252.99.254.
#
#      eth2 connects to a local network.
#
#      #NAME NUMBER MARK DUPLICATE INTERFACE GATEWAY	     OPTIONS	        COPY
#      ISP1  1	    1	 main	   eth0	     206.124.146.254 track,balance      eth2
#      ISP2  2	    2	 main	   eth1	     130.252.99.254  track,balance      eth2
