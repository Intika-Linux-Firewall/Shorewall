# Shorewall - IPPserver Macro
#
# /usr/share/shorewall/macro.IPPserver
#
#	This macro handles Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), indicating
#	that DEST is a printing server for SOURCE.  The macro allows
#	print queue broadcasts from the server to the client, and
#	printing connections from the client to the server.
#
#	Example usage on a single-interface firewall which is a print
#	client:
#		IPPserver/ACCEPT $FW net
#
#	Example for a two-interface firewall which acts as a print
#	server for loc:
#		IPPserver/ACCEPT loc $FW
#
#	NOTE: If you want both to serve requests for local printers and
#	listen to requests for remote printers (i.e. your CUPS server is
#	also a client), you need to apply the rule twice, e.g.
#		IPPserver/ACCEPT loc $FW
#		IPPserver/ACCEPT $FW loc
