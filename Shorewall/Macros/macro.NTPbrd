# Shorewall version 4 - NTPbrd Macro
#
# /usr/share/shorewall/macro.NTPbrd
#
#	This macro handles NTP traffic (ntpd) including replies to Broadcast
#	NTP traffic.
#
#	It is recommended only to use this where the source host is trusted -
#	otherwise it opens up a large hole in your firewall because
#	Netfilter doesn't track connections for broadcast traffic.
