#
# /etc/shorewall/usersets
#
#	This file is used to define Shorewall "User Sets". A user set is a 
#	list of <user>, <group> or <user:group> names and can be used to
#	control access by individual users to other network hosts from the
#	firewall system.
#
# Columns are:
#
#	USERSET		The name of a user set. May be up to 6 characters in
#			length and must be a valid shell identifier.
#
#	USER		A Linux user name or number defined in /etc/passwd.
#
#	GROUP		A linux group name or number defined in /etc/groups.
#
#	The GROUP may be omitted. If it is supplied, then the USER may be 
#	entered as "-" in which case all members of the specified group are
#	included in the USERSET.
