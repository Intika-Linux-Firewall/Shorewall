# Shorewall 1.3 -- Blacklist File
#
# /etc/shorewall/blacklist
#
# This file contains a list of IP addresses, MAC addresses and/or subnetworks.
# When a packet arrives on in interface that has the 'blacklist' option
# specified, its source IP address is checked against this file and disposed of
# according to the BLACKLIST_DISPOSITION and BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL variables in
# /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf
#
# MAC addresses must be prefixed with "~" and use "-" as a separator.
#
# Example: ~00-A0-C9-15-39-78
#
# Each ADDRESS/SUBNET may be optionally followed by a protocol name or number
# and an optional port number. If these are supplied, only packets matching
# the protocol and the port (if supplied) are blocked.
#
# Example:
#
# To block DNS queries from address 192.0.2.126:
#
# ADDRESS/SUBNET	PROTOCOL	PORT
# 192.0.2.126		udp		53
