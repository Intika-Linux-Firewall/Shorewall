#
# Shorewall version 5 - Drop Action
#
# /usr/share/shorewall/action.Drop
#
#	The default DROP common rules
#
#	This action is invoked before a DROP policy is enforced. The purpose
#	of the action is:
#
#	a) Avoid logging lots of useless cruft.
#	b) Ensure that certain ICMP packets that are necessary for successful
#	   internet operation are always ACCEPTed.
#
#  The action accepts five optional parameters:
#
#	1 - 'audit' or '-'. Default is '-' which means don't audit in builtin
#           actions.
#       2 - Action to take with Auth requests. Default is to do nothing special
#	    with them.
#	3 - Action to take with SMB requests. Default is DROP or A_DROP,
#           depending on the setting of the first parameter.
#       4 - Action to take with required ICMP packets. Default is ACCEPT or
#           A_ACCEPT depending on the first parameter.
#       5 - Action to take with late UDP replies (UDP source port 53). Default
#           is DROP or A_DROP depending on the first parameter.
#
# IF YOU ARE HAVING CONNECTION PROBLEMS, CHANGING THIS FILE WON'T HELP!!!!!!!!!
