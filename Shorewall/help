add)
	echo "add: add <interface>[:<host-list>] ... <zone>
    Adds a list of hosts or subnets to a dynamic zone usually used with VPN's.

    shorewall add interface:host-list ... zone - Adds the specified interface
    (and host-list if included) to the specified zone.

    A host-list is a comma-separated list whose elements are:

        A host or network address
        The name of a bridge port
        The name of a bridge port followed by a colon (":") and a host or
        network address.

    Example:

    shorewall add ipsec0:192.0.2.24 vpn1 -- adds the address 192.0.2.24
    from interface ipsec0 to the zone vpn1.

    See also \"help host\""
	;;

address|host)
        echo "<$1>:
    May be either a host IP address such as 192.168.1.4 or a network address in
    CIDR format like 192.168.1.0/24. If your kernel and iptables contain iprange
    match support then IP address ranges of the form <low address>-<high address>
    are also permitted. If your kernel and iptables contain ipset match support
    then you may specify the name of an ipset prefaced by "+". The name of the
    ipsec may be optionally followed by a number of levels of ipset bindings
    (1 - 6) that are to be followed"
	;;

allow)
	echo "allow: allow <address> ...
    Re-enables receipt of packets from hosts previously blacklisted
    by a drop or reject command.

    Shorewall allow, drop, rejct and save implement dynamic blacklisting.

    See also \"help address\""
	;;

check)
	echo "check: check [ <configuration-directory> ]
   Performs a cursory validation of the zones, interfaces, hosts,
   rules, policy, masq, blacklist, proxyarp, nat and provider files.  Use this
   if you are unsure of any edits you have made to the shorewall configuration.
   See the try command examples for a recommended way to make changes."
	;;

clear)
	echo "clear: clear
    Clear will remove all rules and chains installed by Shoreline.
    The firewall is then wide open and unprotected.  Existing
    connections are untouched.  Clear is often used to see if the
    firewall is causing connection problems."
	;;

compile)
	echo "compile: compile [ -e ] [ <directory name> ] <path name>
    Compiles the current configuration into the executable file
    <path name>. If <path name> names a file in /var/lib/shorewall then
    the file may be executed using the \"restore\" command.

    When -e is specified, the compilation is being performed on a system
    other than where the compiled script will run. This option disables
    certain configuration options that require the script to be compiled
    where it is to be run.
	;;

debug)
	echo "debug: debug
    If you include the keyword debug as the first argument to any
    of these commands:

	start|stop|restart|reset|clear|refresh|check|add|delete

    then a shell trace of the command is produced.  For example:

	shorewall debug start 2> /tmp/trace

    The above command would trace the 'start' command and
    place the trace information in the file /tmp/trace.

    The word 'trace' is a synonym for 'debug'."
	;;

delete)
	echo "delete: delete <interface>[:<host-list>] ... <zone>
    Deletes a list of hosts or networks from a dynamic zone usually used with VPN's.

    shorewall delete interface[:host-list] ... zone - Deletes the specified
    interfaces (and host list if included) from the specified zone.

    A host-list is a comma-separated list whose elements are:

        A host or network address
        The name of a bridge port
        The name of a bridge port followed by a colon (":") and a host or
        network address.

    Example:

    shorewall delete ipsec0:192.0.2.24 vpn1 -- deletes the address
    192.0.2.24 from interface ipsec0 from zone vpn1

    See also \"help host\""
	;;

drop)
	echo "$1: $1 <address> ...
    Causes packets from the specified <address> to be ignored

    Shorewall allow, drop, rejct and save implement dynamic blacklisting.

    See also \"help address\""
	;;

dump)
	echo "dump: dump

    shorewall [-x] dump

    Produce a verbose report about the firewall for problem analysis.

    (iptables -L -n -)

    When -x is given, that option is also passed to iptables to display actual packet and byte counts."
	;;

forget)
	echo "forget: forget [ <file name> ]
    Deletes /var/lib/shorewall/<file name>. If no <file name> is given then
    the file specified by RESTOREFILE in shorewall.conf is removed.

    See also \"help save\""
	;;

help)
	echo "help: help [<command> | host | address ]
    Display helpful information about the shorewall commands."
	;;

hits)
    echo "hits: hits
    Produces several reports about the Shorewall packet log messages
    in the current /var/log/messages file."
	;;

ipcalc)
	echo "ipcalc: ipcalc { address mask | address/vlsm }
    Ipcalc displays the network address, broadcast address,
    network in CIDR notation and netmask corresponding to the input[s]."
	;;

ipdecimal)
	echo "ipdecimal: ipdecimal { <IP address> | <integer> }
    Converts an IP address into its 32-bit decimal equivalent and
    vice versa"
	;;

iprange)
	echo "iprange: iprange address1-address2
    Iprange decomposes the specified range of IP addresses into the
    equivalent list of network/host addresses."
	;;

logwatch)
	echo "logwatch: logwatch [<refresh interval>]
    Monitors the LOGFILE, $LOGFILE,
    and produces an audible alarm when new Shorewall messages are logged."
	;;

refresh)
	echo "refresh: [ -q ] refresh
    The rules involving the broadcast addresses of firewall interfaces,
    the black list, traffic control rules and ECN control rules are recreated
    to reflect any changes made.  Existing connections are untouched.

    If \"-q\" is specified, less detain is displayed making it easier to spot warnings"
	;;

reject)
	echo "$1: $1 <address> ...
    Causes packets from the specified <address> to be rejected

    Shorewall allow, drop, rejct and save implement dynamic blacklisting.

    Restart is the same as a shorewall stop && shorewall start.
    Existing connections are maintained.

    If \"-q\" is specified, less detain is displayed making it easier to spot warnings
    If \"-n\" is specified, no changes to routing will be made"
	;;

safe-restart)
	echo "safe-restart: [ -q ] safe-restart
    Restart the same way as a shorewall restart except that previous firewall
    configuration is backed up and will be restored if you notice any anomalies
    or you are not able to reach the firewall any more."
    ;;

safe-start)
	echo "safe-start: [ -q ] safe-start
    Start the same way as a shorewall start except that in case of anomalies
    shorewall clear is issued. "
    ;;

restore)
	echo "restore: restore [ -q ] [ -n ] [ <file name> ]
    Restore Shorewall to a state saved using the 'save' command
    Existing connections are maintained. The <file name> names a restore file in
    /var/lib/shorewall created using \"shorewall save\"; if no <file name> is given
    then Shorewall will be restored from the file specified by the RESTOREFILE
    option in shorewall.conf.

    If \"-q\" is specified, less detain is displayed making it easier to spot warnings
    If \"-n\" is specified, no changes to routing will be made.

    If \"-q\" is specified, less detail is displayed making it easier to spot warnings
    If \"-f\" is specified, the saved configuration specified by the RESTOREFILE option
