1)  Logical interface names in the EXTERNAL column of
    /etc/shorewall/proxyarp were previously not mapped to their
    corresponding physical interface names. This could cause 'start' or
    'restart' to fail.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.8.1

2)  If find_first_interface_address() cannot determine the address of
    the passed interface, the following message is issued and the
    process continues:

    	    /usr/share/shorewall/lib.common: line 438:
                startup_error: command not found

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.8.1

3)  If LOG_VERBOSITY=0 in shorewall.conf, then when the compiled script
    is executed, messages such as the following will be issued:

       /var/lib/shorewall6/.restart: line 65: [: -gt: unary operator
                                              expected

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.8.1
