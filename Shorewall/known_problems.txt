1)  In some simple one-interface configurations, the following Perl
    run-time error messages is issued:

      Generating Rule Matrix...
      Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at
      /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 649.
      Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at
      /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 649.
      Creating iptables-restore input...

    The messages are harmless and can be ignored.

2)  The Shorewall operations log (specified by STARTUP_LOG) is not
    secured 0600.

    To work around the this issue, simply use chmod to change the
    file's permissions.

3)  The compiler generates an incorrect test for interface
    availability in the generated code for adding route rules. The
    result is that the rules are always added, regardless of the
    state of the provider's interface.

    Will be corrected in Shorewall 4.4.4.
