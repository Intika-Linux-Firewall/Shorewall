1)  The change which removed the 15 port limitation on
    /etc/shorewall/routestopped was incomplete. The result is that if
    more than 15 ports are listed, an error is generated.

    This problem is corrected in Shorewall 4.4.4.1.

2)  If any interfaces have the 'bridge' option specified, compilation
    fails with the error:

    Undefined subroutine &Shorewall::Rules::match_source_interface called 
    at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Rules.pm line 2319.

    This problem is corrected in Shorewall 4.4.4.1.
