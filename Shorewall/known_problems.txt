1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  If the output of 'env' contains a multi-line value, then
    compilation failed with an Internal Error.

    Workaround: In /etc/shorewall/params, reset any exported variables
    that have a multi-line value.

    Corrected in 4.4.15.1.

3)  If a params file does not appear in the CONFIG_PATH, compilation
    fails with the error:

    	   .: 31: Can't open /etc/shorewall6/params
	   ERROR: Processing of /etc/shorewall6/params failed

    Workaround: 'touch /etc/shorewall/params' (or
                /etc/shorewall6/params).

    Corrected in 4.4.15.1.
