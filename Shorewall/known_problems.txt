1)  In all versions of Shorewall6 lite, the 'shorecap' program is
    using the 'iptables' program rather than the 'ip6tables' program.
    This causes many capabilities that are not available in IPv6 to
    be incorrectly reported as available.

    This results in errors such as:

    	 ip6tables-restore v1.4.2: Couldn't load match `addrtype':
	   /lib/xtables/libip6t_addrtype.so: cannot open shared
	   object file: No such file or directory

    To work around this problem, on the administrative system:

    a)  Remove the incorrect capabilties file.
    b)  In shorewall6.conf, set the IP6TABLES option to the
        path name of ip6tables on the firewall (example:
	IP6TABLES=/sbin/ip6tables).
    c)  'shorewall6 load <firewall>'.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.1

2)  In a number of cases, Shorewall6 generates incorrect rules
    involving the IPv6 multicast network. The rules specify
    ff00::/10 where they should specify ff00::/8.  Also, rules
    instantiated when the IPv6 firewall is stopped use ff80::/10 rather
    than fe80::/10 (IPv6 link local network).

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.1

3)  Using a destination port-range with :random produces a fatal
    compilation error in REDIRECT rules unless the firewall zone is
    explicitly specified (e.g., $FW::2000-2010:random).

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.1

4)  /sbin/shorewall and /sbin/shorewall6 sometimes fail to honor the
    'nolock' option. In other cases, this option is incorrectly passed
    on to the compiled script, causing the script to issue a usage
    synopsis and to terminate.
 
    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.1

5)  On systems that use the Upstart init system (such as Ubuntu and
    Fedora), Shorewall-init is not reliable at starting the firewall
    during boot when normal firewall startup is disabled and UPDOWN=1
    is specified in /etc/default/shorewall-init.

    Suggested workaround is to not disable normal startup (e.g., do not
    set startup=0 on Debian-based systems and do not 'checkconfig
    --del...' on Fedora).

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.2

6)  A typo in /sbin/shorewall6-lite version 4.4.11.1 causes the
    stop, reset and clear commands to hang for one minute after the
    command had been executed and causes the next shorewall6-lite
    command to similarly hang for one minute.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.2.

7)  A typo in the Shorewall install.sh script prevents the Makefile from
    being installed in /usr/share/shorewall/configfiles/Makefile.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.2.

8)  On systems running Upstart, Shorewall-init cannot reliably close
    the firewall before interfaces come up.

9)  When 'any' is used in the SOURCE column of /etc/shorewall[6]/rules,
    a duplicate rule is generated in all "fw2*" ("fw-* if
    ZONE2ZONE="-"). If 'any' is used in the DEST column, then a
    duplicate rule appears in all "*2fw" (*-fw) chains.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.3.

10) A port range that omits the first port number (e.g., ":80") is
    rejected with the following error:

    	 ERROR: Invalid/Unknown tcp port/service (0) : ......

    A workaround is to specify the first port as 1 (e.g., "1:80").

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.3.

11) AUTOMAKE=Yes is broken -- don't use it.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.3.

12) Under rare circumstances where COMMENT is used to attach comments
    to rules, OPTIMIZE 8 through 15 can result in invalid
    iptables-restore (ip6tables-restore) input.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.4.

13) Under rare circumstances involving exclusion, OPTIMIZE 8 through 15
    can result in invalid iptables-restore (ip6tables-restore) input.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.4.

14) When REQUIRE_INTERFACE=Yes, start/restart will fail unless the last
    optional interface defined in the interfaces file is available.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.4.

15) The compiler erroneously allows non-trivial exclusion in CONTINUE
    rules (tcrules and rules files). The generated iptables (ip6tables)
    rules do not work as expected.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.4.

16) Exclusion in blacklist file entries is correctly validated but is
    then ignored when generating iptables (ip6tables) input.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.4.

17) The interface options combination of 'optional' and 'upnpclient'
    does not work correctly.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.4.

18) The SAME target in tcrules generates invalid iptables-restore
    (ip6tables-restore) input.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.5.

19) The Shorewall-lite and Shorewall6-lite Debian init scripts have a
    syntax error.

    This line:

    [ "$INITLOG" eq "/dev/null" && SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT=1 || SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT=0

    should be:

    [ "$INITLOG" = "/dev/null" ] && SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT=1 || SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT=0

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.6

20) If the -v or -q options are used in /sbin/shorewall-lite or
    /sbin/shorewall6-lite commands that involve the compiled firewall
    script and the resulting effective VERBOSITY is > 2 or < -1, then
    the command will fail.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.6

21) The log-reading commands (show log, logwatch and dump) always
    showed an empty log when issued to one of the -lite packages.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.6

22) If 10 or more interfaces are configured in Complex Traffic Shaping
    (/etc/shorewall/tcdevices), the following compilation diagnostic
    is issued:

        Argument "a" isn't numeric in sprintf at
	/usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line 893.
 
    and an invalid TC configuration is generated.
