1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  Beginning with 4.4.16, compilation will fail if an empty shell
    variable was referenced in a config file on a system where /bin/sh
    is the Bourne Again Shell (bash).

    Corrected in 4.4.16.1.
