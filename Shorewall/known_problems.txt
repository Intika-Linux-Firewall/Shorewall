1)  In all versions of Shorewall6 lite, the 'shorecap' program is
    using the 'iptables' program rather than the 'ip6tables' program.
    This causes many capabilities that are not available in IPv6 to
    be incorrectly reported as available.

    This results in errors such as:

    	 ip6tables-restore v1.4.2: Couldn't load match `addrtype':
	   /lib/xtables/libip6t_addrtype.so: cannot open shared
	   object file: No such file or directory

    To work around this problem, on the administrative system:

    a)  Remove the incorrect capabilties file.
    b)  In shorewall6.conf, set the IP6TABLES option to the
        path name of ip6tables on the firewall (example:
	IP6TABLES=/sbin/ip6tables).
    c)  'shorewall6 load <firewall>'.

2)  In a number of cases, Shorewall6 generates incorrect rules
    involving the IPv6 multicast network. The rules specify
    ff00::/10 where they should specify ff00::/8.
