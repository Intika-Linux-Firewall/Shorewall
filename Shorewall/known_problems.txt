1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  If the output of 'env' contains a multi-line value, then
    compilation failed with an Internal Error.

    Workaround: In /etc/shorewall/params, reset any exported variables
    that have a multi-line value.

    Will be fixed in 4.4.15.1 or 4.4.16, whichever is released first.
