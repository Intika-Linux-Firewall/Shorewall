1)  In some simple one-interface configurations, the following Perl
    run-time error messages is issued:

      Generating Rule Matrix...
      Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at
      /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 649.
      Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at
      /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 649.
      Creating iptables-restore input...

    The messages are harmless and can be ignored.

2)  The Shorewall operations log (specified by STARTUP_LOG) is not
    secured 0600.

    To work around the this issue, simply use chmod to change the
    file's permissions.

3)  The compiler generates an incorrect test for interface
    availability in the generated code for adding route rules. The
    result is that the rules are always added, regardless of the
    state of the provider's interface.

    Will be corrected in Shorewall 4.4.4.

4)  When TC_WIDE_MARKS=Yes and class numbers are not explicitly
    specified in /etc/shorewall/tcclasses, duplicate class numbers
    result. A typical error message is:

    	    ERROR: Command "tc class add dev eth3 parent 1:1 classid
    	    1:1 htb rate 1024kbit ceil 100000kbit prio 1 quantum 1500"
    	    Failed

    Note that the class ID of the class being added is a duplicate of
    the parent's class ID.

    You can work around this problem by explicitly specifying class
    numbers in the INTERFACE column (e.g., 'eth0:2' or '1:2').

    Will be corrected in Shorewall 4.4.4.
