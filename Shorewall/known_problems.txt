1)  If ULOG is specified as the LOG LEVEL in the all->all policy, the
    rules at the end of the INPUT and OUTPUT chains still use the
    LOG target rather than ULOG.

    You can work around this problem by adding two additional policies
    before the all->all one:

    	   all 		$FW	DROP	ULOG
	   $FW		all	REJECT	ULOG

    This problem was corrected in Shorewall 4.4.0.1.

2)  Use of CONTINUE policies with a nested IPSEC zone was broken in
    some cases.

    This problem was corrected in Shorewall 4.4.0.1.

3)  If MULTICAST=Yes in shorewall.conf, multicast traffic is
    incorrectly exempted from ACCEPT policies.

    This problem was corrected in Shorewall 4.4.0.2.

4)  If a zone is defined with "nets=" in /etc/shorewall/zones, that
    definition cannot be extended by entries in /etc/shorewall/hosts.

    This problem was corrected in Shorewall 4.4.0.2.

5)  Shoerwall accepts "nets=" in a multi-zone interface entry (one with
    "-" in the ZONES column) in /etc/shorewall/interfaces.

    This problem was corrected in Shorewall 4.4.0.2.

6)  MULTICAST=Yes generates an incorrect rule that limits its
    effectiveness to a small part of the multicast address space.
