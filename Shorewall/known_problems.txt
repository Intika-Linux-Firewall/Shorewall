1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably start the
    firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The date/time formatting in the STARTUP_LOG is not uniform.

    Fixed in 4.4.13.1

3)  The blacklisting change in 4.4.13 broke blacklisting in some simple
    configurations with the effect that blacklisting was not enabled.

    Fixed in 4.4.13.1

    The issue may also be worked around is follows.

    If you currently have an entry similar to this in
    /etc/shorewall/interfaces:

       #ZONE         INTERFACE BROADCAST        OPTIONS
       net 	     eth0      detect		blacklist,...

    then remove the 'blacklist' option from that entry and change the
    'net' entry in /etc/shorewall/zones as follows:

       #ZONE       TYPE       OPTIONS       IN_OPTIONS
       net         ipv4       -             blacklist
