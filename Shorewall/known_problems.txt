1)  In kernel 2.6.31, the handling of the rp_filter interface option was
    changed incompatibly. Previously, the effective value was determined
    by the setting of net.ipv4.config.dev.rp_filter logically ANDed with
    the setting of net.ipv4.config.all.rp_filter.

    Beginning with kernel 2.6.31, the value is the arithmetic MAX of
    those two values. 

    Given that Shorewall sets net.ipv4.config.all.rp_filter to 1 if
    there are any interfaces specifying 'routefilter', specifying
    'routefilter' on any interface has the effect of setting the option
    on all interfaces.

    A workaround for this problem is included in Shorewall 4.4.5.1.

2)  When using an up-to-date capabilities file with Shorewall 4.4.5.1, the
    following warning messages were issued.

       WARNING: Unknown capability (KERNELVERSION) 
         ignored : /etc/shorewall2/capabilities (line 49)
       WARNING: Your capabilities file does not contain a Kernel Version --
         using 2.6.30

    This defect was corrected in 4.4.5.2.

3)  'shorewall6 start' on Shorewall 4.4.5.2 generates a Perl run-time
    error. Also, handling of ROUTE_FILTER on kernel 2.6.31 and later
    was broken.

    This was fixed in 4.4.5.3.

4)  With Shorewall 4.4.5.3, using a capabilities file with Shorewall6
    will result in the following warnings during compilation:

       WARNING: Your capabilities file is out of date -- it does not
          contain all of the capabilities defined by Shorewall6 version
          4.4.5.3

       WARNING: Your capabilities file does not contain a Kernel
          Version -- using 2.6.30

    Corrected in 4.4.5.4.

5)  The change in Shorewall 4.4.5.1 broke the 'forward' interface
    option in Shorewall6.

    Corrected in 4.4.5.4.
