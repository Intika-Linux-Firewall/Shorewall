1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.19.1

2)  There is a harmless duplicate ACCEPT rule in the INPUT filter chain
    when the firewall is stopped.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.19.1

3)  Shorewall interprets all 'nexthop' routes as default routes when
    analyzing the pre-start routing configuration. This can lead to
    unwanted default routes when the firewall was started or stopped.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.19.1

3)  A defect introduced in Shorewall 4.4.17 broke the ability to
    specify ':<low port>-<high port>' in the ADDRESS column of 
    /etc/shorewall/masq.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.19.1
