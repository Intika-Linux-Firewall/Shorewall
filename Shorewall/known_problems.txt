1)  If ULOG is specified as the LOG LEVEL in the all->all policy, the
    rules at the end of the INPUT and OUTPUT chains still use the
    LOG target rather than ULOG.

    You can work around this problem by adding two additional policies
    before the all->all one:

    	   all 		$FW	DROP	ULOG
	   $FW		all	REJECT	ULOG
