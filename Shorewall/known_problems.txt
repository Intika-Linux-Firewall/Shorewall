1)  'shorewall check' produces an internal error if 'routeback' appears
    in /etc/shorewall/routestopped.

    You can work around this problem by using 'source' rather than
    'routeback'.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.2.1.

2)  'routestopped' appearing in /etc/shorewall/routestopped doesn't
    work (routeback traffic is not allowed).

    You can work around this problem by using 'source' rather than
    'routeback'.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.2.2.
