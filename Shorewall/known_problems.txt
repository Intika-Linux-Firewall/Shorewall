1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  A harmless 'unitialized variable' diagnostic is issued by the 
    compiler when it is displaying the capabilities.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.21.

3)  As the result of a typo, an orphan filter chain named FORWAR can
    be created under rare circumstances. This chain is deleted by
    OPTIMIZE level 4.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.21.

4)  The SNAT options --persistent and --randomize (/etc/shorewall/masq)
    generate invalid iptables input.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.21.

5)  The LOGMARK log level was generated invalid iptables  input making
    it unusable.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.21.
