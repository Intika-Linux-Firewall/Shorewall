1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably start the
    firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The date/time formatting in the STARTUP_LOG is not uniform.

    Fixed in 4.4.13.1

3)  The blacklisting change in 4.4.13 broke blacklisting in some simple
    configurations with the effect that blacklisting was not enabled.

    Fixed in 4.4.13.1
