1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably start the
    firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  If a route exists for an entire RFC1918 subnet (10.0.0.0/8,
    172.20.0.0/12 or 192.168.0.0/16), then setting
    NULL_ROUTE_RFC1918=Yes will cause the route to be replaced with an
    'unreachable' one.

3)  Shorewall6 fails to start correctly if all the following are true:

    - Shorewall was installed using the tarball. It may have
      subsequently been installed using a distribution-specific package
      or the rpm from shorewall.net without first unstalling the
      tarball components.

    - Shorewall6 was installed using a distribution-specific package or
      the rpm from shorewall.net.

    - The file /etc/shorewall6/init was not created.
