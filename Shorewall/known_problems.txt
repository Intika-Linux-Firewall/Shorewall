1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The 4.4.20 Shorewall6 installer always installs the 'plain'
    (unannotated) version of shorewall6.conf, regardless of the '-p'
    option.

3)  Fixed item 1 from 4.4.19.4 was inadvertently omitted from
    4.4.20.

2)  A defect introduced in 4.4.20 can cause the following failure at
    start/restart:

	ERROR: Command "tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent 1:11 handle 1:
                        sfq quantum 12498 limit 127 perturb 10" failed

    The error occurs when explicit interface numbers are assigned in
    /etc/shorewall/tcdevices and the default HTB queuing discipline is
    used.
