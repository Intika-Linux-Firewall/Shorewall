1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  An issue with params processing on RHEL6 manifested as the
    following type of warning:


       WARNING: Param line (export OLDPWD) ignored at 
                /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line
                2993.

     Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.18.1

3)  The Shorewall Lite and Shorewall6 Lite installers fail to install
    the 'helpers' modules file, with the result that both
    'shorewall[6]-lite show capabilities' and 'shorecap' fail. 

    Workaround: Copy the 'helpers' file from the Administrative System
    to the firewall system.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.18.1
