# Shorewall 1.3 - /etc/shorewall/tunnels
#
#	This file defines IPSEC, GRE and IPIP tunnels.
#
#	IPIP and GRE tunnels must be configured on the firewall/gateway itself.
#	IPSEC endpoints may be defined on the firewall/gateway or on an
#	internal system.
#
#	The columns are:
#
#	TYPE	    --	must start in column 1 and be "ipsec", "ip" or "gre"
#
#	ZONE	    --	The zone of the physical interface through which
#			tunnel traffic passes. This is normally your internet
#			zone.
#
#	GATEWAY	    --	The IP address of the remote tunnel gateway. If the
#			remote getway has no fixed address (Road Warrior)
#			then specify the gateway as 0.0.0.0/0.
#
#	GATEWAY ZONE--	Optional. If the gateway system specified in the third
#			column is a standalone host then this column should
#			contain the name of the zone that the host is in. This
#			column only applies to IPSEC tunnels.
#
#		Example 1:
#
#			IPSec tunnel. The remote gateway is 4.33.99.124 and
#			the remote subnet is 192.168.9.0/24
#
#			ipsec	net	4.33.99.124
#
#		Example 2:
#
#			Road Warrior (LapTop that may connect from anywhere)
#			where the "gw" zone is used to represent the remote
#			LapTop.
#
#			ipsec	net	0.0.0.0/0	gw
#
#		Example 3:
#
#			Host 4.33.99.124 is a standalone system connected
#			via an ipsec tunnel to the firewall system. The host
#			is in zone gw.
#
#			ipsec	net	4.33.99.124	gw
