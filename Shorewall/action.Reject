# Shorewall version 4 - Reject Action
#
# /usr/share/shorewall/action.Reject
#
#	The default REJECT action common rules
#
#	This action is invoked before a REJECT policy is enforced. The purpose
#	of the action is:
#
#	a) Avoid logging lots of useless cruft.
#	b) Ensure that certain ICMP packets that are necessary for successful
#	   internet operation are always ACCEPTed.
#
# IF YOU ARE HAVING CONNECTION PROBLEMS, CHANGING THIS FILE WON'T HELP!!!!!!!!!
