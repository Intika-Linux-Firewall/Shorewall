#
# Shorewall 1.4 /etc/shorewall/params
#
# Assign any variables that you need here.
#
# It is suggested that variable names begin with an upper case letter
# to distinguish them from variables used internally within the
# Shorewall programs
#
# Example:
#
#	NET_IF=eth0
#	NET_BCAST=130.252.100.255
#	NET_OPTIONS=routefilter,norfc1918
#
# Example (/etc/shorewall/interfaces record):
#
#	net	$NET_IF		$NET_BCAST	$NET_OPTIONS
#
# The result will be the same as if the record had been written
#
#	net	eth0		130.252.100.255	routefilter,norfc1918
#
# Variables can be used in the following places in the other configuration
# files:
#
# /etc/shorewall/interfaces:
# /etc/shorewall/hosts
#
# 	All except the first column.
#
# /etc/shorewall/rules
#
#	First column after ":".
#	All remaining columns
#
# /etc/shorewall/tunnels
# /etc/shorewall/proxyarp
# /etc/shorewall/nat
#
#	All columns
