# /etc/shorewall/zones
#
#	This file determines your network zones.
#
# Columns are:

#	ZONE	Short name of the zone (5 Characters or less in length).
#		The names "all" and "none" are reserved and may not be
#		used as zone names.
#
#	IPSEC	Yes --	Communication with all zone hosts is encrypted
#	ONLY		Your kernel and iptables must include policy
#			match support.
#		No  --	Communication with some zone hosts may be encrypted.
#			Encrypted hosts are designated using the 'ipsec'
#			option in /etc/shorewall/hosts.
#
#	OPTIONS,	A comma-separated list of options as follows:
#	IN OPTIONS,
#	OUT OPTIONS	reqid=<number> where <number> is specified
#			using setkey(8) using the 'unique:<number>
#			option for the SPD level.
#
#			spi=<number> where <number> is the SPI of
#			the SA used to encrypt/decrypt packets.
#
#			proto=ah|esp|ipcomp
#
#			mss=<number> (sets the MSS field in TCP packets)
#
#			mode=transport|tunnel
#
#			tunnel-src=<address>[/<mask>] (only
#			available with mode=tunnel)
#
#			tunnel-dst=<address>[/<mask>] (only

#
#	The options in the OPTIONS column are applied to both incoming
#	and outgoing traffic. The IN OPTIONS are applied to incoming
#	traffic (in addition to OPTIONS) and the OUT OPTIONS are
#	applied to outgoing traffic.
#
#	If you wish to leave a column empty but need to make an entry
#	in a following column, use "-".
