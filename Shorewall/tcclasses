# /etc/shorewall/tcclasses
#
#	Define the classes used for traffic shaping in this file.
#
#	A note on the rate/bandwidth definitions used in this file:
#
#		- don't use a space between the integer value and
#		  the unit: 30kbit is valid while 30 kbit is NOT.
#
#		- you can use one of the following units:
#
#       		kbps		Kilobytes per second
#       		mbps   		Megabytes per second
#       		kbit   		Kilobits per second
#      			mbit   		Megabits per second
#      			bps or a
#			bare number	Bytes per second
#
#		- if you want the values to be calculated for you depending
#		on the output bandwidth setting defined for an interface
#		in tcdevices, you can use expressions like the following:
#
#			full/3		causes the bandwidth to be calculated
#					as 3 of the the full outgoing
#					speed that is defined.
#
#			full*9/10	will set this bandwidth to 9/10 of
#					the full bandwidth
#
#		DO NOT add a unit to the rate if it is calculated !
#
# Columns are:
#
#	INTERFACE	Name of interface. Each interface may be listed only
#			once in this file. You may NOT specify the name of
#			an alias (e.g., eth0:0) here; see
#			http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq18
#
#			You may NOT specify wildcards here,  e.g. if you
#			have multiple ppp interfaces, you need to put
#			them all in here!
#
#			Please note that you can only use interface names
#			in here that have a bandwidth defined in the tcdevices
#			file
#
#	MARK		The mark value which is an integer in the range 1-255.
#			You define this marks in the tcrules file, marking
#			the traffic you want to fit in the classes defined
#			in here.
#
#			You can use the same marks for different Interfaces
#
#	RATE		The minimum bandwidth this class should get,
#			when the traffic load rises. Please note
#			that first the classes which equal or a lesser priority
#			value are served.
#
#			You can use the following
#Use kbit or kbps(for Kilobytes per second) for
#			speed, and make sure there is NO space between the
#			number and the unit.
#
#	CEIL		The maximum bandwidth this class is allowed to use
#			when the link is idle. Useful if you have traffic
#			which can get full speed when more needed services
#			(e.g. ssh) are not used.
#
#			You can use the value "full" in here for setting
#			the maximum bandwidth to the defined output bandwidth
#			of that interface
#
#			Use kbit or kbps(for Kilobytes per second) for
#			speed, and make sure there is NO space between the
#			number and the unit.
#
#	PRIORITY	you have to define a priority for the class
#			Packages in a class with a higher priority (=lesser value)
#			are handled before lesser priority onces.
#			You can just define the mark value here also, if you are
#			increasing the mark values with lesser priority.
#
#	OPTIONS         A comma-separated list of options including the
#			following:
#
#			default		- this is the default class for that
#					interface where all traffic should go,
#					that is not classified otherwise.
#
#					NOTE: defining default for exactly one
#					class per interface is mandatory!
#
#			tos-<tosname>	- this lets you define a filter for
#					the given <tosname> which lets you
#					define a value of the Type Of Service
#					bits in the ip packet which causes
#					the packet to go in this class.
#					Please note, that this filter overrides
#					all mark settings, so if you define
#					a tos filter for a class all traffic
#					having that mark will go in it regard-
#					less of the mark on the packet.
#					You can use the following
#					for this option
#
#   					tos-minimize-delay (16)
#                               	tos-maximize-throughput (8)
#                               	tos-maximize-reliability (4)
#                               	tos-minimize-cost (2)
#                               	tos-normal-service (0)
#
#					NOTE: each of this options is only
#					valid for ONE class per interface.
#
#			tcp-ack		- if defined causes an tc filter to
#					be created that puts all tcp ack
#					packets on that interface that have
#					an size of <=64 Bytes to go in this
#					class. This is useful for speeding up
#					downloads. Please note that the size
#					of the ack packets is limited to 64
#					bytes as some applications (p2p for
#					example) use to make every packet an
#					ack packet which would cause them
#					all into here. We want only packets
#					WITHOUT payload to match, so the size
#					limit.
#
#					NOTE: This option is only valid for
#					ONE class per interface.
#
#
#
#	Example 1:	Suppose you are using PPP over Ethernet (DSL)
#			and ppp0 is the interface for this. The
#			device has an outgoing bandwidth of 500kbit.
#			You have 3 classes here, the first you can use for
#			interactive traffic (ssh) the second for p2p networking
#			and the last one the rest. They all have a guaranteed
#			bandwidth of 100kbit upstream, but 1 and 3 can get
#			full speed if link is idle, 2 is limited to 200kbit
#
#			ppp0  1  100kbit  full	   1  tcp-ack,tos-minimize-delay
#			ppp0  2	 100kbit  200kbit  2
#			ppp0  3	 full/3  full/2	   3  default
