# Shorewall version 3.2 - Tcdevices File
#
# Based on tc4shorewall version 0.5 by Arne Bernin
#
# /etc/shorewall/tcdevices
#
#	Entries in this file define the bandwidth for interfaces
#	on which you want traffic shaping to be enabled.
#
#	If you do not plan to use traffic shaping for a device,
#	don't put it in here as it limits the troughput of that
#	device to the limits you set here.
#
# Columns are:
#
#
#	INTERFACE	Name of interface. Each interface may be listed only
#			once in this file. You may NOT specify the name of
#			an alias (e.g., eth0:0) here; see
#			http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq18
#	
#			You man NOT specify wildcards here,  e.g. if you
#			have multiple ppp interfaces, you need to put
#			them all in here!
#
#			Any device listed in this column must exist at the
#			time that Shorewall is [re]started.
#
#	IN-BANDWIDTH	The incoming Bandwidth of that interface. Please
#			note that you are not able to do traffic shaping
#			on incoming traffic, as the traffic is already
#			received before you could do so. But this allows
#			you to define the maximum traffic allowed for
#			this interface in total, if the rate is exceeded,
#			the packets are dropped.
#			You want this mainly if you have a DSL or Cable
#			connection to avoid queuing at your providers side.
#
#			If you don't want any traffic to be dropped set this
#			to a value faster than your interface.
#
#			Use kbit or kbps(for Kilobytes per second) for
#			speed, and make sure there is NO space between the
#			number and the unit.
#
#	OUT-BANDWIDTH	The outgoing Bandwidth of that interface. 
#			This is the maximum speed you connection can handle.
#			It is also the speed you can refer as "full" if
#			you define the tc classes. 
#			Outgoing traffic above this rate will be dropped.
#
#			Use kbit or kbps(for Kilobytes per second) for
#			speed, and make sure there is NO space between the
#			number and the unit.
#
#	Example 1:	Suppose you are using PPP over Ethernet (DSL)
#			and ppp0 is the interface for this. The
#			device has an outgoing bandwidth of 500kbit and an
#			incoming bandwidth of 6000kbit
#			ppp0	6000kbit	500kbit
