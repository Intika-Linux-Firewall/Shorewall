Changes since 1.2.13

1. Changed all file versions to 1.3

2. Changed the rules file and firewall file to implement the new forwarding
   and redirection syntax.
   
3. Removed the sample rules from the rules file -- the quickstart samples
   should provide those sample rules.
   
4. Added a silent Auth reject rule to common.def.

5. Changed the handling of the nat table to have a separate chain for each
   source zone.
   
6. Removed the code that tested each rules column for "none" -- this was never
   documented and was there to support the brain-dead parameterized samples.
   
7. Reworked the chain structure in the filter table so that each interface has
   its own input and forward chain.
   
8. Added logic to allow a subzone to be excluded from a DNAT or REDIRECT rule.
