# Shorewall version 3.2 - Started File
#
# /etc/shorewall/started
#
#	Add commands below that you want to be executed after shorewall has
#	been completely started or restarted. The difference between this
#	extension script and /etc/shorewall/start is that this one is invoked
#	after delayed loading of the blacklist (DELAYBLACKLISTLOAD=Yes) and
#	after the 'shorewall' chain has been created (thus signaling that the
#	firewall is completely up.
#
#	This script should not change the firewall configuration directly but
#	may do so indirectly by running /sbin/shorewall with the 'nolock'
#	option.
#
# See http://shorewall.net/shorewall_extension_scripts.htm for additional
# information. Note though that the "ensure_and_save_command" function
# should not be used in this script because Shorewall is already running
# when this function is called.
