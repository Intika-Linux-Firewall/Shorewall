This is a minor release of Shorewall that has a couple of new features.

New features include:

1) "shorewall refresh" now reloads the traffic shaping rules (tcrules
   and tcstart).

2) "shorewall debug [re]start" now turns off debugging after an error
   occurs. This places the point of the failure near the end of the
   trace rather than up in the middle of it.

3) "shorewall [re]start" has been speeded up by more than 40% with
   my configuration. Your milage may vary. 

4) A "shorewall show classifiers" command has been added which shows
   the current packet classification filters. The output from this
   command is also added as a separate page in "shorewall monitor"

5) ULOG (must be all caps) is now accepted as a valid syslog level and
   causes the subject packets to be logged using the ULOG target rather
   than the LOG target. This allows you to run ulogd (available from
   www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd) and log all Shorewall messages to
   a separate log file.

6) If you are running a kernel that has a FORWARD chain in the mangle
   table ("shorewall show mangle" will show you the chains in the
   mangle table), you can set MARK_IN_FORWARD=Yes in
   shorewall.conf. This allows for marking input packets based on their
   destination even when you are using Masquerading or SNAT.

7) I have cluttered up the /etc/shorewall directory with empty 'init',
   'start', 'stop' and 'stopped' files. If you already have a file with
   one of these names, don't worry -- the upgrade process won't
   overwrite your file.
