This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected since version 1.4.8:

1) There has been a low level of confusion over the terms "Source NAT" (SNAT)
   and "Static NAT". To avoid future confusion, all instances of "Static
   NAT" have been replaced with "One-to-one NAT" in the documentation and
   configuration files.

Migration Issues:

None.

New Features:

1) To cut down on the number of "Why are these ports closed rather than
   sealthed?" questions, the SMB-related rules in
   /etc/shorewall/common.def have been changed from 'reject' to 'DROP'.
