This is a minor release of Shorewall that has a number of new features..

New features include:

1) You may now define the contents of a zone dynamically with the 
   "shorewall add" and "shorewall delete" commands. These commands
   are expected to be used primarily within FreeS/Wan updown scripts.
    
2) Shorewall can now do MAC verification on ethernet segments. You can
   specify the set of allowed MAC addresses on the segment and you can
   optionally tie each MAC address to an IP address.
    
3) PPTP Servers and Clients running on the firewall system may now be
   defined in the /etc/shorewall/tunnels file.

4) A new 'ipsecnat' tunnel type is supported for use when the remote
   IPSEC endpoint is behind a NAT gateway.
    
5) The PATH used by Shorewall may now be specified in
   /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf.
   
6) The main firewall script is now /usr/lib/shorewall/firewall. The
   script in /etc/init.d/shorewall is very small and uses
   /sbin/shorewall to do the real work. This change makes custom
   distributions such as for Debian and for Gentoo easier to manage
   since it is /etc/init.d/shorewall that tends to have
   distribution-dependent code.
