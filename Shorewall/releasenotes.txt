This is a minor release of Shorewall.

In this release:

1. Empty and invalid source and destination qualifiers are now detected
   in the rules file. It is a good idea to use the 'shorewall check'
   command before you issue a 'shorewall restart' command be be sure
   that you don't have any configuration problems that will prevent a
   successful restart.

2. Added MERGE_HOSTS variable in shorewall.conf to provide saner
   behavior of the /etc/shorewall/hosts file.

3. The time that the counters were last reset is now displayed in the
   heading of the 'status' and 'show' commands.

4. Added MUTEX_TIMEOUT variable in shorewall.conf and changed the way
   in which Shorewall protects itself from concurrent state
   changes. 

   Previously, if a state-changing operation (like restart)
   found a lock file, it would wait for 30 seconds for the lock file to
   be removed. If the file was not removed within 30 seconds, a message
   was issued and the operation was aborted. 

   With the new code, the wait time is determined by the value of
   MUTEX_TIMEOUT (default 60 seconds). If the file is not removed
   within MUTEX_TIMEOUT, the state-changing operation will assume that
   the lock file is stale and will issue a message and continue.

   An appopriate setting for MUTEX_TIMEOUT is twice the time that it takes
   your firewall system to process a "shorewall restart" command.
