This is a minor release of Shorewall.

In this release:

1. The handling of "all z CONTINUE" policies has been corrected. Use of
   these policies greatly simplifies whitelisting and other nested zone
   configuration.
   
2. Added an /etc/shorewall/rfc1918 configuration file for defining the
   behavior of the 'norfc1918' interface option.
