Shorewall 3.3.0
	  	 
 Note to users upgrading from Shorewall 3.0 or 3.2	 
  	 
    Most problems associated with upgrades come from two causes: 	 
	  	 
    - The user didn't read and follow the migration considerations in these 	 
      release notes. 	 
	  	 
    - The user mis-handled the /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf file during 	 
      upgrade. Shorewall is designed to allow the default behavior of 	 
      the product to evolve over time. To make this possible, the design 	 
      assumes that you will not replace your current shorewall.conf file 	 
      during upgrades. If you feel absolutely compelled to have the latest 	 
      comments and options in your shorewall.conf then you must proceed 	 
      carefully. 	 
	  	 
    While you are at it, if you have a file named /etc/shorewall/rfc1918 then 	 
    please check that file. If it has addresses listed that are NOT in one of 	 
    these three ranges, then please rename the file to 	 
    /etc/shorewall/rfc1918.old. 	 
  	 
         10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 	 
         172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 	 
         192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 	 
  	 
    If you have a file named /etc/shorewall/modules, please remove 	 
    it. The default modules file is now located in /usr/share/shorewall/ 	 
    (see the "Migration Considerations" below). 	 
  	 
    Please see the "Migration Considerations" below for additional upgrade 	 
    information.
