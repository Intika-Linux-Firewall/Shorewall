1)  It is now possible to control the layout of packet and connection
    marks.

2)  A new simplified Traffic Shaping facility is now available.

1)  The deprecated macro invocation form <macro>/<param> (e.g.,
    Ping/ACCEPT) now causes a compiler warning to be generated. Only
    the first occurrance is flagged with a warning.

2)  Prior versions of Shorewall applied PREROUTING marking rules to all
    packets from 'tracked' provider interfaces when
    TC_EXPERT=No. Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.0, packets from these
    interfaces will only have those rules applied when TC_EXPERT=Yes.

1)  Previously, if there were entries in /etc/shorewall/accounting,
    OPTIMIZE settings of 4, 5, 6 or 7 could cause a run-time failure
    during 'shorewall start'. 

    As part of this fix, accounting chains are now exempted from the
    optimizations enabled with the 4-bit in OPTIMIZE is set.

    User-defined action chains are similarly exempted.

1)  The OPTIMIZE bit 4 feature added in 4.5.1 is now extended to all
    tables.

    Additionally, if a builtin chain has a single rule that branches to
    another chain, then the rules from the target chain are moved to
    the builtin chain and the target chain is omitted.

2)  Shorewall now throws an error if:

    a) There are tracked providers; and
    b) PROVIDER_OFFSET is 0; and
    c) 'ipp2p' is used as the PROTO in a tcpri entry.

1)  The shorewall.conf options WIDE_TC_MARKS and HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS are
    now deprecated in favor of a new set of options that define the layout
    of the 32-bit packet/connection mark.

        TC_BITS           Number of bits at the least-significant end
       			  of the mark used for traffic shaping. Marks
       			  used for traffic shaping must have a value
       			  between 1 and 2**TC_BITS - 1.

        PROVIDER_OFFSET   The offset in bits from the least-significant
			  end of the mark where the provider mark field
       			  begins. If zero, the provider mark occupies
       			  the same area as the traffic shaping
       			  mark. Otherwise, the value specified must
       			  be greater than or equal to MASK_BITS
       			  (below). Shorewall will automatically adjust
       			  a non-zero PROVIDER_OFFSET to meet this
       			  requirement.

	PROVIDER_BITS	  Number of bits reserved for routing
			  marks. Provider marks must have a value
			  between 2**PROVIDER_OFFSET and
			  2**(PROVIDER_OFFSET + PROVIDER_BITS) - 1.

	MASK_BITS	  Number of 1 bits in the default mask when
			  specifying a test on the packet or connection
			  mark. These tests appear in the TEST column
			  of shorewall-tcrules (5) and in the MARK
			  columns of shorewall-accounting (5),
			  shorewall-masq (5) and shorewall-tos (5). The
			  bits defined by the default mask are also
			  retained after a packet is routed when
			  PROVIDER_OFFSET is non-zero. The remaining
			  bits are cleared.

    The default values of these new options depend on WIDE_TC_MARKS and
    HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS as follows:

        WIDE_TC_MARKS=No and HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=No; both the traffic shaping
    	mark and the provider mark occupy the low-order 8 bits of the mark.

             TC_BITS	     	  8
	     PROVIDER_OFFSET	  0
	     PROVIDER_BITS	  8
	     MASK_BITS	          8

   	WIDE_TC_MARKS=No and HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes; the traffic shaping
   	mark occupies the low-order 8 bits of the mark and the provider
   	mark occupies the next 8 bits.

   	     TC_BITS	    	  8
	     PROVIDER_OFFSET	  8
	     PROVIDER_BITS	  8
	     MASK_BITS	          8

   	WIDE_TC_MARKS=Yes and HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=No; the traffic shaping
   	mark occupies the low-order 14 bits of the mark and the
   	provider mark occupies the low-order 8 bits.

   	     TC_BITS	    	 14
	     PROVIDER_OFFSET	  0
	     PROVIDER_BITS	  8
	     MASK_BITS	         16

   	WIDE_TC_MARKS=Yes and HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes; the traffic shaping
   	mark occupies the low-order 14 bits of the mark followed by two
   	unused bits followed by the 8-bit provider mark.
 
	     TC_BITS	    	 14
	     PROVIDER_OFFSET	 16
	     PROVIDER_BITS	  8
	     MASK_BITS	         16

    These defaults provide behavior that is compatable with the earlier
    implementation. They may be overridden by setting the new options
    directly.

    At verbosity levels 1 and 2, the compiler provides information as
    follows (this example is with HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes and
    WIDE_TC_MARKS=Yes and none of the new options set explicitly):

	******** Packet/Connection Mark Information ********
	TC Mark Values       = 1 - 16383 (0x3fff)
   	Default Mask         = /0xffff
   	Provider Mark Values = 0x10000 - 0xff0000
   	****************************************************
    
    As shown, the information includes the range of acceptable TC mark
    values, the default mask in MARK columns (TEST column in
    /etc/shorewall/tcrules) and the range of acceptable provider mark
    values. The default mask is determined by the setting of MASK_BITS.

2)  The OPTIMIZE option value is now a bit-map with each bit
    controlling a separate set of optimizations.

    - The low-order bit (value 1) controls optimizations available in
      earlier releases.

    - The next bit (value 2) suppresses superfluous ACCEPT rules in a
      policy chain that implements an ACCEPT policy. Any ACCEPT rules
      that immediately preceed the final blanket ACCEPT rule in the
      chain are now omitted.

3)  Shorewall now combines identical logging chains. Previously, a
    separate chain was created for each logging rule.

4)  Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.0, accounting can be disabled by
    setting ACCOUNTING=No in shorewall.conf. This allows you to keep a
    set of accounting rules configured in /etc/shorewall/accounting and
    to then enable and disable them by simply toggling the setting of
    ACCOUTING.

    Similarly, dynamic blacklisting can be disabled by setting
    DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=No. This saves a jump rule in filter chains INPUT
    and FORWARD.

5)  Shorewall can now automatically assign mark values to providers in
    cases where 'track' is specified (or TRACK_PROVIDERS=Yes) but
    packet marking is otherwise not used for directing connections to a
    particular provider. Simplly specify '-' in the MARK column and
    Shorewall will automatically assign a mark value equal to the last
    used mark value + 1.

6)  It is now possible to enable a simplified traffic shaping
    facility by setting TC_ENABLED=Simple in shorewall.conf.

    See http://www.shorewall.net/simple_traffic_shaping.html for
    details.

7)  You may now restrict the output of 'show tc' by specifying the name
    of an interface (e.g., "show tc eth0").

8)  COMMENT lines are now allowed in /etc/shorewall/tcpri.

9)  The '4' bit in the OPTIMIZE option now enables additional
    optimizations:

    a) Empty chains are optimized away.
    b) Chains with one rule are optimized away.

    The following chains are exempted from optimization:

    	action chains (user-created).
    	accounting chains
    	dynamic
	forwardUPnP
	logdrop
	logreject
	UPnP (nat table).

10) The PROTO column in /etc/shorewall/tcpri may now contain
    'ipp2p'. When such an entry is present and PROVIDER_OFFSET is
    non-zero, Shorewall will automatically generate SAVE/RESTORE rules
    for the POSTROUTING chain.
