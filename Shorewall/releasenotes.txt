This is a minor release of Shorewall which rolls up a number of bug
fixes.

New features include:

1) The 'icmp.def' file is now empty! The rules in that file were
   required in ipchains firewalls but are not required in Shorewall. 
   Users who have ALLOWRELATED=No in shorewall.conf should see the
   Upgrade Issues.
2) A 'FORWARDPING' option has been added to shorewall.conf. The effect
   of setting this variable to Yes is the same as the effect of adding
   an ACCEPT rule for ICMP echo-request in
   /etc/shorewall/icmpdef. Users who have such a rule in icmpdef are
   encouraged to switch to FORWARDPING=Yes.
3) The loopback CLASS A Network (127.0.0.0/8) has been added to the
   rfc1918 file.
4) Shorewall now works with iptables 1.2.7.
5) The documentation and Web site no longer use FrontPage themes.

I would like to thank John Distler for his valuable input regarding TCP
SYN and ICMP treatment in Shorewall. That input has led to marked
improvement in Shorewall in the last two releases.
