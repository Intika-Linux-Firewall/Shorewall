This is a minor release of Shorewall.

In this release:

1. A new /etc/shorewall/routestopped file has been added. This file is 
   intended to eventually replace the routestopped option in the 
   /etc/shorewall/interface and /etc/ shorewall/hosts files. This new 
   file makes remote firewall administration easier by allowing any IP 
   or subnet to be enabled while Shorewall is stopped.

2. An /etc/shorewall/stopped extension script has been added. This 
   script is invoked after Shorewall has stopped.

3. A DETECT_DNAT_ADDRS option has been added to 
   /etc/shoreall/shorewall.conf. When this option is selected, DNAT 
   rules only apply when the destination address is the external
   interface's primary IP address.

4. The QuickStart Guide has been broken into three guides and has been
   almost entirely rewritten.

5. The Samples have been updated to reflect the new capabilities in
   this release.
