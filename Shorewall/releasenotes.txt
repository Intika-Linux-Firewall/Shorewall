This is a major release of Shorewall.

In this release:

1. The rules syntax for port forwarding and port redirection has been 
   simplified.
   
2. Compatibility has been maintained with version 1.2 configurations so
   that users may migrate their configuration at their convenience.
   
WARNING: Compatibility has NOT been maintained with the parameterized
         sample configurations which were withdrawn on 4/8/2002. Users
	 still employing one of those samples must upgrade to the
	 latest samples before running Shorewall 1.3 (Beta or Release).
	 
3. You may now exclude zone A from a DNAT or REDIRECT rule that applies
   to zone B where zone A is a subzone of sone B.
