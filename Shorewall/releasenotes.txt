This is a major release of Shorewall.

Function from 1.3 that has been omitted from this version include:

1) The MERGE_HOSTS variable in shorewall.conf is no longer
   supported. Shorewall 2.0 behavior is the same as 1.3 with
   MERGE_HOSTS=Yes.

2. Interface names of the form <device>:<integer> in
   /etc/shorewall/interfaces now generate an error.

3. Shorewall 2.0 implements behavior consistent with
   OLD_PING_HANDLING=No. OLD_PING_HANDLING=Yes will generate an error
   at startup as will specification of the 'noping' or 'filterping'
   interface options.

4. The 'routestopped' option in the /etc/shorewall/interfaces and
   /etc/shorewall/hosts files is no longer supported and will generate
   an error at startup if specified.

5. The Shorewall 1.2 syntax for DNAT and REDIRECT rules is no longer
   accepted.

6. The ALLOWRELATED variable in shorewall.conf is no longer
   supported. Shorewall 2.0 behavior is the same as 1.3 with
   ALLOWRELATED=Yes.

Changes for 2.0 include:

1. shorewall.conf has been completely reorganized into logical
   sections.

2. LOG is now a valid action for a rule (/etc/shorewall/rules).

3. The firewall script and version file are now installed in
   /usr/share/shorewall.

4. Late arriving DNS replies are now silently dropped in the common
   chain by default.

5. In addition to behaving like OLD_PING_HANDLING=No, Shorewall 2.0 no
   longer unconditionally accepts outbound ICMP packets. So if you want
   to 'ping' from the firewall, you will need the appropriate rule or
   policy.
