This is a minor release of Shorewall.

In this release:

1. Empty and invalid source and destination qualifiers are now detected
   in the rules file. It is a good idea to use the 'shorewall check'
   command before you issue a 'shorewall restart' command be be sure
   that you don't have any configuration problems that will prevent a
   successful restart.

2. Added MERGE_HOSTS variable in shorewall.conf to provide saner
   behavior of the /etc/shorewall/hosts file.

3. The time that the counters were last reset is now displayed in the
   heading of the 'status' and 'show' commands.
