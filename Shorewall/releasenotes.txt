This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Changes are:

a) Where an entry in the/etc/shorewall/hosts file specifies a
   particular host or network, Shorewall now creates an intermediate
   chain for handling input from the related zone. This can
   substantially reduce the number of rules traversed by connections
   requests from such zones.
