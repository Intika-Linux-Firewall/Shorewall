This is a minor release of Shorewall that has a couple of new features.

New features include:

1) "shorewall refresh" now reloads the traffic shaping rules.
2) "shorewall debug [re]start" now turns off debugging after an error
   occurs. This places the point of the failure near the end of the
   trace rather than up in the middle of it.
3) "shorewall [re]start" has been speeded up by approximately 40% with
   my configuration. Your milage may vary.
