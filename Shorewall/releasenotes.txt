This is a minor release of Shorewall which rolls up a number of bug
fixes.

New features include:

1) The new "Shorewall Setup Guide" is included in this release. This
   guide is intended for users who have multiple static external IP
   addresses and for users who what to learn a bit more abound
   Shorewall than is described in the single-address guides.

2) A new 'newnotsyn' extension script has been provided for the benefit
   of those users who are experimenting with treatment of TCP packets
   that are not part of or related to an existing connection and that
   do not have the SYN flag set and the ACK flag reset. 


3) The 'init' extension script is now called AFTER all existing user
   chains have been deleted. Previously, this script was called just
   before the chains were deleted.
