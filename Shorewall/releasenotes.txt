New Features in Shorewall 4.3.5

New Features in Shorewall 4.4

1)  The Shorewall packaging has been completely revamped in Shorewall
    4.4.

    The new packages are:

    - Shorewall.   Includes the former Shorewall-common and
                   Shorewall-perl packages. Includes everything needed
                   to create an IPv4 firewall.

    - Shorewall6.  Requires Shorewall. Adds the components necessary to
      		   create an IPv6 firewall.

    - Shorewall-lite

		   May be installed on a firewall system to run
		   IPv4 firewall scripts generated by Shorewall.

    - Shorewall6-lite

		   May be installed on a firewall system to run
		   IPv6 firewall scripts generated by Shorewall.

2)  The interfaces file supports a new 'nets=' option. This option
    allows users to restrict a zone's definition to particular networks
    through an interface without having to use the hosts file.

    Example interfaces file:

    #ZONE	INTERFACE	BROADCAST		OPTIONS
    loc		eth3		detect			dhcp,logmartians=1,routefilter=1,nets=172.20.1.0/24
    dmz     	eth4		detect			logmartians=1,routefilter=1,nets=206.124.146.177
    net		eth0		detect			dhcp,blacklist,tcpflags,optional,routefilter=0,nets=(!172.20.0.0/24,206.124.146.177)
    net		eth2		detect			dhcp,blacklist,tcpflags,optional,upnp,routefilter=0,nets=(!172.20.0.0/24,206.124.146.177)
    loc		tun+		detect			nets=172.20.0.0/24
    #LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE

    Note that when more than one network address is listed, the list
    must be enclosed in parentheses. Notice also that exclusion may be
    used.

    The first entry in the above interfaces file is equivalent to the
    following:

    interfaces:

    #ZONE	INTERFACE	BROADCAST		OPTIONS
    -		eth0		detect			dhcp,logmartians=1,routefilter=1

    hosts:

    #ZONE	HOST(S)					OPTIONS
    loc		$INT_IF:192.20.1.0/24			broadcast

    Note that the 'broadcast' option is automatically assumed and need
    not be explicitly specified.
