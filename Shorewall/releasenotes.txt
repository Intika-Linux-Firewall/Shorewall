This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

1) There were several cases where Shorewall would fail to remove a
   temporary directory from /tmp. These cases have been corrected.

New Features:

1) IPV6-IPV4 (6to4) tunnels are now supported in the
   /etc/shorewall/tunnels file.

2) Shorewall can now be easily integrated with fireparse
   (http://www.fireparse.com) by setting LOGMARKER="fp=" in
   /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf.
