This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

New Features:

1) A REDIRECT- rule target has been added. This target behaves for
   REDIRECT in the same was as DNAT- does for DNAT in that the
   Netfilter nat table REDIRECT rule is added but not the companion
   filter table ACCEPT rule.

2) The LOGMARKER variable has been renamed LOGFORMAT and has been
   changed to a 'printf' formatting template which accepts three
   arguments (the chain name, logging rule number and the disposition).
   To use LOGFORMAT with fireparse, set it as:

       LOGFORMAT="fp=%s:%d a=%s "


   CAUTION: /sbin/shorewall uses the leading part of the LOGFORMAT
   string (up to but not including the first '%') to find log messages
   in the 'show log', 'status' and 'hits' commands. This part should
   not be omitted (the LOGFORMAT should not begin with "%") and the
   leading part should be sufficiently unique for /sbin/shorewall to
   identify Shorewall messages.

3) When logging is specified on a DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-] rule, the
   logging now takes place in the nat table rather than in the filter
   table. This way, only those connections that actually undergo DNAT
   or redirection will be logged.
