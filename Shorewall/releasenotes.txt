This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

New Features:

1) A REDIRECT- rule target has been added. This target behaves for
   REDIRECT in the same was as DNAT- does for DNAT in that the
   Netfilter nat table REDIRECT rule is added but not the companion
   filter table ACCEPT rule.

2) The LOGMARKER variable has been renamed LOGFORMAT and has been
   changed to a 'printf' formatting template which accepts three
   arguments (the chain name, logging rule number and the disposition).
   To use LOGFORMAT with ULOG, set it as:

       LOGFORMAT="fp=%s:%d a=%s"
