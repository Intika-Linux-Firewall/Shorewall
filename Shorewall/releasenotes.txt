This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected since version 1.4.8:

1) There has been a low continuing level of confusion over the terms
   "Source NAT" (SNAT) and "Static NAT". To avoid future confusion, all
   instances of "Static NAT" have been replaced with "One-to-one NAT"
   in the documentation and configuration files.

2) The description of NEWNOTSYN in shorewall.conf has been reworded for
   clarity.

Migration Issues:

None.

New Features:

1) To cut down on the number of "Why are these ports closed rather than
   stealthed?" questions, the SMB-related rules in
   /etc/shorewall/common.def have been changed from 'reject' to 'DROP'.

2) For easier identification, packets logged under the 'norfc1918'
   interface option are now logged out of chains named
   'rfc1918'. Previously, such packets were logged under chains named
   'logdrop'.

3) Distributors and developers seem to be regularly inventing new
   naming conventions for kernel modules. To avoid the need to change
   Shorewall code for each new convention, the MODULE_SUFFIX option has
   been added to shorewall.conf. MODULE_SUFFIX may be set to the suffix
   for module names in your particular distribution. If MODULE_SUFFIX
   is not set in shorewall.conf, Shorewall will use the list "o gz ko
   o.gz".

   To see what suffix is used by your distribution:

      ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter

   All of the files listed should have the same suffix (extension). Set
   MODULE_SUFFIX to that suffix.

   Examples: 

	    If all files end in ".kzo" then set MODULE_SUFFIX="kzo"
	    If all files end in ".kz.o" then set MODULE_SUFFIX="kz.o"

4) Support for user defined rule ACTIONS has been implemented through
   two new files:

   /etc/shorewall/actions         - used to list the user-defined ACTIONS.
   /etc/shorewall/action.template - For each user defined <action>, copy
				    this file to
				    /etc/shorewall/action.<action> and
				    add the appropriate rules for that
				    <action>.
   Once an <action> has been defined, it may be used like any of the
   builtin ACTIONS (ACCEPT, DROP, etc.) in /etc/shorewall/rules.

   Example: You want an action that logs a packet at the 'info' level
   and accepts the connection.

   In /etc/shorewall/actions, you would add:

      LogAndAccept

   You would then copy /etc/shorewall/action.template to
   /etc/shorewall/LogAndAccept and in that file, you would add the two
   rules:

	LOG:info
	ACCEPT
