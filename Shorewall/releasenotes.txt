This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

1) TCP connection requests rejected out of the common chain are now
   properly rejected with TCP RST; previously, some of these requests
   were rejeced with an ICMP port-unreachable response.

New Features:

1) Where an entry in the/etc/shorewall/hosts file specifies a
   particular host or network, Shorewall now creates an intermediate
   chain for handling input from the related zone. This can
   substantially reduce the number of rules traversed by connections
   requests from such zones.
