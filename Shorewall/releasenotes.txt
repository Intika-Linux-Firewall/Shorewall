This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected since version 1.4.9:

None.

Migration Issues:

None.

New Features:

1) The INTERFACE column in the /etc/shorewall/masq file may now
   specify a destination list. 

   Example:

	#INTERFACE			SUBNET		ADDRESS
	eth0:192.0.2.3,192.0.2.16/28	eth1

   If the list begins with "!" then SNAT will occur only if the
   destination IP address is NOT included in the list.
