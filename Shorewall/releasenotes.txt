This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected since version 1.4.6:

1) Tuomo Soini has supplied a correction to a problem that occurs using
   some versions of 'ash'. The symptom is that "shorewall start" fails
   with:

   local: --limit: bad variable name
   iptables v1.2.8: Couldn't load match `-j':/lib/iptables/libipt_-j.so: 
   cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
   Try `iptables -h' or 'iptables --help' for more information.

2) Andres Zhoglo has supplied a correction that avoids trying to use
   the multiport match iptables facility on ICMP rules.

   Example of rule that previously caused "shorewall start" to fail:

	   ACCEPT      loc  $FW  icmp    0,8,11,12

3) Previously, if the following error message was issued, Shorewall
   was left in an inconsistent state.

   Error: Unable to determine the routes routes through interface xxx

4) Handling of the LOGUNCLEAN option in shorewall.conf has been
   corrected.

Migration Issues:

None.

New Features:

1. A new QUEUE action has been introduced for rules. QUEUE allows you
   to pass connection requests to a user-space filter such as p2pwall
   (http://p2pwall.sourceforge.net).

   For example, to use p2pwall to filter P2P applications, you would
   add the following rules:

   QUEUE   loc	     net	tcp
   QUEUE   loc	     net	udp
   QUEUE   loc	     fw		udp

   You would normally want to place those two rules BEFORE any ACCEPT
   rules for loc->net.

   Note: When the protocol specified is TCP ("tcp", "TCP" or "6"),
   Shorewall will only pass connection requests (SYN packets) to user
   space. This is for compatibility with p2pwall.

2. A BLACKLISTNEWNONLY option has been added to shorewall.conf. When
   this variable is set to "Yes", the blacklists (dynamic and static)
   are only consulted for new connection requests. When set to "No"
   (the default if the variable is not set), the blacklists are
   consulted on every packet.

   Setting this variable to "No" allows blacklisting to stop existing
   connections from a newly blacklisted host but is more expensive in
   terms of packet processing time. This is especially true if the
   blacklists contain a large number of entries.
