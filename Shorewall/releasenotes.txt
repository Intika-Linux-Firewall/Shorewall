This is a minor release of Shorewall.

In this release:

1. Entries in /etc/shorewall/interface that use the wildcard character
   ("+") now have the "multi" option assumed.

2. The 'rfc1918' chain in the mangle table has been renamed 'man1918'
   to make log messages generated from that chain distinguishable from
   those generated by the 'rfc1918' chain in the filter table.
