This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

None.

Migration Issues:

1) Once you have installed this version of Shorewall, you must 
   restart Shorewall before you may use the 'drop', 'reject', 'allow'
   or 'save' commands. 

New Features:

1) Shorewall now creates a dynamic blacklisting chain for each interface
   defined in /etc/shorewall/interfaces. The 'drop' and 'reject'
   commands use the routing table to determine which of these chains is
   to be used for blacklisting the specified IP address(es).
