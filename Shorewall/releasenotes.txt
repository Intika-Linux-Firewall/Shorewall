This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

1) A problem seen on RH7.3 systems where Shorewall encountered start
   errors when started using the "service" mechanism has been worked
   around.

2) Where a list of IP addresses appears in the DEST column of a DNAT[-]
   rule, Shorewall incorrectly created multiple DNAT rules in the nat
   table (one for each element in the list). Shorewall now correctly
   creates a single DNAT rule with multiple "--to-destination" clauses.

New Features:

1) A 'newnotsyn' interface option has been added. This option may be
   specified in /etc/shorewall/interfaces and overrides the setting
   NEWNOTSYN=No for packets arriving on the associated interface.

2) The means for specifying a range of IP addresses in
   /etc/shorewall/masq to use for SNAT is now
   documented. ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes is enabled for address ranges.

3) Shorewall can now add IP addresses to subnets other than the first
   one on an interface.

4) DNAT[-] rules may now be used to load balance (round-robin) over a
   set of servers. Up to 256 servers may be specified in a range of
   addresses given as <first address>-<last address>.

   Example:

	DNAT net loc:192.168.10.2-192.168.10.5 tcp 80

   Note that this capability has previously been available using a
   combination of a DNAT- rule and one or more ACCEPT rules. That
   technique is still preferable for load-balancing over a large number
   of servers (> 16) since specifying a range in the DNAT rule causes
   one filter table ACCEPT rule to be generated for each IP address in
   the range.

5) The NAT_ENABLED, MANGLE_ENABLED and MULTIPORT configuration options
   have been removed and have been replaced by code that detects
   whether these capabilities are present in the current kernel. The
   output of the start, restart and check commands have been enhanced
   to report the outcome:

   Shorewall has detected the following iptables/netfilter capabilities:
      NAT: Available
      Packet Mangling: Available
      Multi-port Match: Available
   Verifying Configuration...

6) Support for the Connection Tracking Match Extension has been
   added. This extension is available in recent kernel/iptables
   releases and allows for rules which match against elements in
   netfilter's connection tracking table.

   Shorewall automatically detects the availability of this extension
   and reports its availability in the output of the start, restart and
   check commands.

   Shorewall has detected the following iptables/netfilter capabilities:
      NAT: Available
      Packet Mangling: Available
      Multi-port Match: Available
      Connection Tracking Match: Available
   Verifying Configuration...

   If this extension is available, the ruleset generated by Shorewall
   is changed in the following ways:

   a) To handle 'norfc1918' filtering, Shorewall will not create chains
      in the mangle table but will rather do all 'norfc1918' filtering in
      the filter table (rfc1918 chain).

   b) Recall that Shorewall DNAT rules generate two netfilter rules;
      one in the nat table and one in the filter table. If the Connection
      Tracking Match Extension is available, the rule in the filter table
      is extended to check that the original destination address was the
      same as specified (or defaulted to) in the DNAT rule.

7) The shell used to interpret the firewall script
   (/usr/share/shorewall/firewall) may now be specified using the
   SHOREWALL_SHELL parameter in shorewall.conf.

8) An 'ipcalc' command has been added to /sbin/shorewall.

      ipcalc [ <address> <netmask> | <address>/<vlsm> ]

   Examples:

      [root@wookie root]# shorewall ipcalc 192.168.1.0/24
         CIDR=192.168.1.0/24
         NETMASK=255.255.255.0
         NETWORK=192.168.1.0
         BROADCAST=192.168.1.255
      [root@wookie root]#

      [root@wookie root]# shorewall ipcalc 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
         CIDR=192.168.1.0/24
         NETMASK=255.255.255.0
         NETWORK=192.168.1.0
         BROADCAST=192.168.1.255
      [root@wookie root]#
