This is a minor release of Shorewall that has a couple of new features.

New features include:

1) An OLD_PING_HANDLING option has been added to shorewall.conf. When
   set to Yes, Shorewall ping handling is as it has always been (see
   http://www.shorewall.net/ping.html).

   When OLD_PING_HANDLING=No, icmp echo (ping) is handled via rules and
   policies just like any other connection request. The FORWARDPING
   option in shorewall.conf is ignored and the 'noping' and
   'filterping' options in /etc/shorewall/interfaces will generate an
   error.
