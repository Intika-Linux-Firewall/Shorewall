This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

1) The command "shorewall debug try <directory>" now correctly traces
   the attempt.

2) Shorewall now works properly with RedHat errata kernels and
   2.4.21-rc1. In these kernels, the REJECT target with "--reject-with
   tcp-reset" behaves like DROP when invoked on a packet that is being
   forwarded by the firewall. Shorewall now only uses that target when
   it is certain that the run will not be invoked on packets whose
   destination is another host.

New Features:

1) The ORIGINAL DEST column in a DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-] rule may now
   contain a list of addresses. If the list begins with "!' then the
   rule will take effect only if the original destination address in
   the connection request does not match any of the addresses listed.
