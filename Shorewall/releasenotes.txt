This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

New Features:

1) A REDIRECT- rule target has been added. This target behaves for
   REDIRECT in the same was as DNAT- does for DNAT in that the
   Netfilter nat table REDIRECT rule is added but not the companion
   filter table ACCEPT rule.
