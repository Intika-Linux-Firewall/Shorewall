Shorewall 3.3.0

Note to users upgrading from Shorewall 2.x or 3.0

   Most problems associated with upgrades come from two causes:

   - The user didn't read and follow the migration considerations in these
     release notes.

   - The user mis-handled the /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf file during
     upgrade. Shorewall is designed to allow the default behavior of
     the product to evolve over time. To make this possible, the design
     assumes that you will not replace your current shorewall.conf file
     during upgrades. If you feel absolutely compelled to have the latest
     comments and options in your shorewall.conf then you must proceed
     carefully.

   While you are at it, if you have a file named /etc/shorewall/rfc1918 then
   please check that file. If it has addresses listed that are NOT in one of
   these three ranges, then please rename the file to
   /etc/shorewall/rfc1918.old.

	10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
	172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

   If you have a file named /etc/shorewall/modules, please remove
   it. The default modules file is now located in /usr/share/shorewall/
   (see the "Migration Considerations" below).

   Please see the "Migration Considerations" below for additional upgrade
   information.

Problems Corrected in 3.3.0

None.

Other changes in 3.3.0

1) Support for dynamic zones (DYNAMIC_ZONES=Yes in shorewall.conf and
   the /sbin/shorewall "add" and "delete" commands) has been
   removed. Please use ipsets to implement dynamic zones as described
   in http://www.shorewall.net/DynamicZones.html.

2) The 'try' command has been re-implemented. The command now does the
   following:

       - shorewall save
       - shorewall restart <specified directory>
       - if the restart is not successful, the configuration is
         automatically restored
       - otherwise, if a timeout is given then 
	 - sleep for the number of seconds specified and
	 - shorewall restore
