This is a minor release of Shorewall which rolls up a number of bug
fixes.

New features include:

1. DNS Names are now allowed in Shorewall config files.

2. The connection SOURCE may now be qualified by both interface
   and IP address in a Shorewall rule.

3. Shorewall startup is now disabled after initial installation until
   the file /etc/shorewall/shorewall_disabled is removed.
