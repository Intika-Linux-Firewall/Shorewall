This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected since version 1.4.9:

None.

Migration Issues:

None.

New Features:

1) The INTERFACE column in the /etc/shorewall/masq file may now
   specify a destination list. 

   Example:

	#INTERFACE			SUBNET		ADDRESS
	eth0:192.0.2.3,192.0.2.16/28	eth1

   If the list begins with "!" then SNAT will occur only if the
   destination IP address is NOT included in the list.

2) Output traffic control rules (those with the firewall as the source)
   may now be qualified by the effective userid and/or effective group
   id of the program generating the output. This feature is courtesy of 
   Frédéric LESPEZ.

   A new USER column has been added to /etc/shorewall/tcrules.

   It may contain :

      [<user name or number>]:[<group name or number>]

   The colon is optionnal when specifying only a user.

       Examples : john: / john / :users / john:users
