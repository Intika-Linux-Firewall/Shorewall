This is a minor release of Shorewall.

In this release:

1. A new "logwatch" command has been added to the /sbin/shorewall program.

2. Shorewall can now take advantage of the Netfilter 'multiport' match
   function (kernel configuration option CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MULTIPORT).  
   
3. Dynamic blacklisting is now supported through the use of three new 
   commands in /sbin/shorewall:

   deny - drop packets from one or more hosts.
   reject - reject packets from one or more hosts.
   allow - reverse the effect of a prior 'deny' or 'reject' command.
   save - save the current dynamic blacklisting settings so that they 
          will be applied the next time that Shorewall is started.

4. The 'firewall', 'version' and 'functions' files have been moved from
   /etc/shorewall to /var/lib/shorewall.
