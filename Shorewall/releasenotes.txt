This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected since version 1.4.8:

1) There has been a low continuing level of confusion over the terms
   "Source NAT" (SNAT) and "Static NAT". To avoid future confusion, all
   instances of "Static NAT" have been replaced with "One-to-one NAT"
   in the documentation and configuration files.

Migration Issues:

None.

New Features:

1) To cut down on the number of "Why are these ports closed rather than
   stealthed?" questions, the SMB-related rules in
   /etc/shorewall/common.def have been changed from 'reject' to 'DROP'.

2) For easier identification, packets logged under the 'norfc1918'
   interface option are now logged out of chains named
   'rfc1918'. Previously, such packets were logged under chains named
   'logdrop'.
