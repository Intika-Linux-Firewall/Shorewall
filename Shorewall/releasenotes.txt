This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

1) A problem seen on RH7.3 systems where Shorewall encountered start
   errors when started using the "service" mechanism has been worked
   around.

New Features:

1) A 'newnotsyn' interface option has been added. This option may be
   specified in /etc/shorewall/interfaces and overrides the setting
   NEWNOTSYN=No for packets arriving on the associated interface.

2) The means for specifying a range of IP addresses in
   /etc/shorewall/masq to use for SNAT is now
   documented. ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes is enabled for address ranges.

3) Shorewall can now add IP addresses to subnets on an interface other
   than the first one.
