This is a major release of Shorewall.

In this release:

1. The rules syntax for port forwarding and port redirection has been 
   simplified.
   
2. Compatibility has been maintained with version 1.2 configurations so
   that users may migrate their configuration at their convenience.
   
WARNING: Compatibility has NOT been maintained with the parameterized
         sample configurations which were withdrawn on 4/8/2002. Users
	 still employing one of those samples must upgrade to the
	 latest samples before running Shorewall 1.3 (Beta or Release).
	 
3. You may now exclude zone A from a DNAT or REDIRECT rule that applies
   to zone B where zone A is a subzone of sone B.
   
4. The whitelist capability has been deimplemented. With recent changes
   to the firewall structure and change 3. above, white lists are now
   best implemented using zones as shown at:
   
   http://www.shorewall.net/whitelisting_under_shorewall.htm 
	 
5. A 'filterping' interface option has been added to allow the 
   rules and policy files to control the handling of ICMP echo-request
   (ping) requests that are addressed to the firewall.
