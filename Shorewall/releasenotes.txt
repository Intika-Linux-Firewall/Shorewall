This is a minor release of Shorewall.

In this release:

1. Entries in /etc/shorewall/interface that use the wildcard character
   ("+") now have the "multi" option assumed.

2. The 'rfc1918' chain in the mangle table has been renamed 'man1918'
   to make log messages generated from that chain distinguishable from
   those generated by the 'rfc1918' chain in the filter table.

3. Interface names appearing in the hosts file are now validated
   against the interfaces file.

4. The TARGET column in the rfc1918 file is now checked for
   correctness.

5. The 'hits' command has been enhanced.

6. The structure of chains in the nat table has been changed to reduce
   the number of rules that packets must traverse and to correct
   problems with NAT_BEFORE_RULES=No.
