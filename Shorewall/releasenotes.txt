This is a minor release of Shorewall that has a couple of new features.

New features include:

1) A 'tcpflags' option has been added to entries in
   /etc/shorewall/interfaces. This option causes Shorewall to make a
   set of sanity check on TCP packet header flags.

2) It is now allowed to use 'all' in the SOURCE or DEST column in a
   rule. When used, 'all' must appear by itself (in may not be
   qualified) and it does not enable intra-zone traffic (e.g., the rule
   "ACCEPT loc	  all	  tcp 80" does not enable http traffic from
   'loc' to 'loc').

3) Shorewall's use of the 'echo' command is now compatible with bash
   clones such as ash and dash.

4) fw->fw policies now generate a startup error. fw->fw rules generate
   a warning and are ignored.
