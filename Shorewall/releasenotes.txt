This is a major release of Shorewall.

Function from 1.3 that has been omitted from this version includes:

1) The MERGE_HOSTS variable in shorewall.conf is no longer
   supported. Shorewall 1.4 behavior is the same as 1.3 with
   MERGE_HOSTS=Yes.

2. Interface names of the form <device>:<integer> in
   /etc/shorewall/interfaces now generate an error.

3. Shorewall 1.4 implements behavior consistent with
   OLD_PING_HANDLING=No. OLD_PING_HANDLING=Yes will generate an error
   at startup as will specification of the 'noping' or 'filterping'
   interface options.

4. The 'routestopped' option in the /etc/shorewall/interfaces and
   /etc/shorewall/hosts files is no longer supported and will generate
   an error at startup if specified.

5. The Shorewall 1.2 syntax for DNAT and REDIRECT rules is no longer
   accepted.

6. The ALLOWRELATED variable in shorewall.conf is no longer
   supported. Shorewall 1.4 behavior is the same as 1.3 with
   ALLOWRELATED=Yes.

7. The 'multi' interface option is no longer supported. Shorewall will
   generate rules for sending packets back out the same interface
   that they arrived on in two cases:

   a) There is an _explicit_ policy for the source zone to the
   destination zone. An explicit policy names both zones and does not
   use the 'all' reserved word.

   b) There are one or more rules for traffic for the source zone to
   or from the destination zone including rules that use the 'all'
   reserved word. Exception: If the source and the destination are
   the same zone then the rule must be explicit - it must name the zone
   in both the SOURCE and DESTINATION columns.

Changes for 1.4 include:

1. shorewall.conf has been completely reorganized into logical
   sections.

2. LOG is now a valid action for a rule (/etc/shorewall/rules).

3. The firewall script and version file are now installed in
   /usr/share/shorewall.

4. Late arriving DNS replies are now silently dropped in the common
   chain by default.

5. In addition to behaving like OLD_PING_HANDLING=No, Shorewall 1.4 no
   longer unconditionally accepts outbound ICMP packets. So if you want
   to 'ping' from the firewall, you will need the appropriate rule or
   policy.

6. CONTINUE is now a valid action for a rule (/etc/shorewall/rules).

7. 802.11b devices with names of the form wlan<n> now support the
   'maclist' option.

8. IMPORTANT: Shorewall now REQUIRES the iproute package ('ip'
   utility).

9. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN - RFC 3168) may now be turned
   off on a host or network basis using the new /etc/shorewall/ecn
   file. To use this facility:

   a) You must be running kernel 2.4.20
   b) You must have applied the patch in
   http://www.shorewall/net/pub/shorewall/ecn/patch.
   c) You must have iptables 1.2.7a installed.
