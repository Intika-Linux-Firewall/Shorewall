# Shorewall version 1.4 - Accounting File
#
# /etc/shorewall/accounting

#	Accounting rules exist simply to count packets and bytes in categories
#	that you define in this file. You may display these rules and their
#	packet and byte counters using the "shorewall show accounting" command.

#	as wildcards
#
# Columns are:
#
#	ACTION	      - What to do when a match is found.

#				COUNT	- Simply count the match and continue
#					  with the next rule
#				DONE	- Count the match and don't attempt

#					  create the chain automatically.
