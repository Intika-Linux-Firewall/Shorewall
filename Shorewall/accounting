# Shorewall version 1.4 - Accounting File
#
# /etc/shorewall/accounting
#
#	Accounting rules exist simply to count packets and bytes in categories
#	that you define in this file. You may display these rules and their
#	packet and byte counters using the "shorewall show accounting" command.
#
#	Please see http://shorewall.net/Accounting.html for examples and 
#	additional information about how to use this file.
#
#	This file has two sections -- the first section is used to create a
#	hierarchy of accounting chains. The second section creates rules to
#	count traffic through your firewall.
#
# In the first section of this file, entries have the following columns:
#
#	ACTION	      -	Must contain CHAIN
#
#	CHAIN	      - The name of a chain to create. Shorewall will create
#			this chain. If the chain already exists, a warning
#			message is issued and the entry is ignored.
#
#	NEXT CHAIN    - Optional - The name of a previously-created chain
#
#	If the NEXT CHAIN column is empty then Shorewall will add a single
#	RETURN rule to the chain named in the CHAIN column. If the NEXT 
#	CHAIN column is not empty then Shorewall will add a jump from the
#	newly-created chain to the chain named in the NEXT CHAIN column.
#	
#ACTION		CHAIN		NEXT CHAIN	

# ADD YOUR CHAIN DECLARATIONS ABOVE THIS LINE
#
# Columns in the second section of this file are are:
#
#	ACTION	      - What to do when a match is found.
#
#				COUNT	- Simply count the match and continue
#					  with the next rule
#				DONE	- Count the match and don't attempt
#					  to match any other accounting rules.
#				<chain> - The name of a chain. Shoreall will 
#					  create the chain automatically if
#					  it was not created by an earlier 
#					  CHAIN declaration above.
#
#	SOURCE	      - Packet Source
#
#			The name of an interface, an address (host or net) or
#			an interface name followed by ":"
#			and a host or net address. 
#
#	DESTINATION   - Packet Destination

#			Format the same as the SOURCE column.
#
#	PROTOCOL	A protocol name (from /etc/protocols), a protocol
#			number.
#
#	DEST PORT	Destination Port number

#			only be specified if the protocol is TCP or UDP (6
#			or 17). 
#
#	SOURCE PORT	Source Port number
#
#			Service name from /etc/services or port number. May
#			only be specified if the protocol is TCP or UDP (6
