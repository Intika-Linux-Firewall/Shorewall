# Shorewall version 3.4 - Accounting File
#
# /etc/shorewall/accounting
#
#	Accounting rules exist simply to count packets and bytes in categories
#	that you define in this file. You may display these rules and their
#	packet and byte counters using the "shorewall show accounting" command.
#
#	Please see http://shorewall.net/Accounting.html for examples and
#	additional information about how to use this file.
#
#
# Columns are:
#
#	ACTION	      - What to do when a match is found.
#
#				COUNT	- Simply count the match and continue
#					  with the next rule
#				DONE	- Count the match and don't attempt
#					  to match any other accounting rules
#					  in the chain specified in the CHAIN
#					  column.
#				<chain>[:COUNT]
#					- Where <chain> is the name of
#					  a chain. Shorewall will create
#					  the chain automatically if it
#					  doesn't already exist. Causes
#					  a jump to that chain. If :COUNT
#					  is including, a counting rule
#					  matching this record will be
#					  added to <chain>
#
#	CHAIN	      - The name of a chain. If specified as "-" the
#			'accounting' chain is assumed. This is the chain
#			where the accounting rule is added. The chain will
#			be created if it doesn't already exist.
#
#	SOURCE	      - Packet Source
#
#			The name of an interface, an address (host or net) or
#			an interface name followed by ":"
#			and a host or net address.
#
#	DESTINATION   - Packet Destination
#
#			Format the same as the SOURCE column.
#
#	PROTOCOL	A protocol name (from /etc/protocols), a protocol
#			number, "ipp2p", "ipp2p:udp" or "ipp2p:all"
#
#	DEST PORT(S)	Destination Port number. If the PROTOCOL is "ipp2p"
#			then this column must contain an ipp2p option
#			("iptables -m ipp2p --help") without the leading
#			"--". If no option is given in this column, "ipp2p"
#			is assumed.
#
#			Service name from /etc/services or port number. May
#			only be specified if the protocol is TCP or UDP (6
#			or 17).
#
#			You may place a comma-separated list of port numbers in
#			this column if your kernel and iptables include
#			multiport match support.
#
#	SOURCE PORT(S)	Source Port number
#
#			Service name from /etc/services or port number. May
#			only be specified if the protocol is TCP or UDP (6
#			or 17).
#
#			You may place a comma-separated list of port numbers in
#			this column if your kernel and iptables include
#			multiport match support.
#
#	USER/GROUP	This column may only be non-empty if the CHAIN is
#			OUTPUT.
#
#			The column may contain:
#
#	[!][<user name or number>][:<group name or number>][+<program name>]
#
#			When this column is non-empty, the rule applies only
#			if the program generating the output is running under
#			the effective <user> and/or <group> specified (or is
#			NOT running under that id if "!" is given).
#
#			Examples:
#
#				joe	#program must be run by joe
#				:kids	#program must be run by a member of
#					#the 'kids' group
#				!:kids	#program must not be run by a member
#					#of the 'kids' group
#				+upnpd	#program named upnpd (This feature was
#					#removed from Netfilter in kernel
#					#version 2.6.14).
#
#	In all of the above columns except ACTION and CHAIN, the values "-",
#	"any" and "all" may be used as wildcards
#
# Please see http://shorewall.net/Accounting.html for examples and
# additional information about how to use this file.
