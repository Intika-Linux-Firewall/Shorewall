#
# Shorewall version 3.2 - Maclist file
#
# /etc/shorewall/maclist
#
#	This file is used to define the MAC addresses and optionally their
#	associated IP addresses to be allowed to use the specified interface.
#	The feature is enabled by using the maclist option in the interfaces
#	or hosts configuration file.
#
# Columns are:
#
#	DISPOSITION	ACCEPT or DROP (if MACLIST_TABLE=filter, then REJECT
#			is also allowed)
#
#	INTERFACE	Network interface to a host. If the interface
#			names a bridge, it may be optionally followed by
#			a colon (":") and a physical port name (e.g.,
#			br0:eth4).
#
#	MAC		MAC address of the host -- you do not need to use
#			the Shorewall format for MAC addresses here. If IP
#			ADDRESSES is supplied then MAC can be supplied as
#			a dash ("-")
#
#	IP ADDRESSES	Optional -- if specified, both the MAC and IP address
#			must match. This column can contain a comma-separated
#			list of host and/or subnet addresses. If your kernel
#			and iptables have iprange match support then IP
#			address ranges are also allowed.
#
# For additional information, see http://shorewall.net/MAC_Validation.html
