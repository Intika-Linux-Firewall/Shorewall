# Shorewall 2.0 - /etc/shorewall/hosts
#
#    WARNING: 90% of Shorewall users don't need to add entries to this
#             file and 80% of those who try to add such entries get it
#	      wrong. Unless you are ABSOLUTELY SURE that you need entries
#	      in this file, don't touch it!
#
#	This file is used to define zones in terms of subnets and/or
#	individual IP addresses. Most simple setups don't need to
#	(should not) place anything in this file.
#
#	ZONE	- The name of a zone defined in /etc/shorewall/zones
#
#	HOST(S)	- The name of an interface followed by a colon (":") and
#		  either:
#
#			a) The IP address of a host
#			b) A subnetwork in the form
#			   <subnet-address>/<mask width>
#		  
#		  The interface must be defined in the
#		  /etc/shorewall/interfaces file.
#
#		  Examples:
#
#			eth1:192.168.1.3
#			eth2:192.168.2.0/24	
#
#	OPTIONS - A comma-separated list of options. Currently-defined
#		  options are:
#
#			maclist	     - Connection requests from these hosts
#				       are compared against the contents of
#				       /etc/shorewall/maclist. If this option
#				       is specified, the interface must be
#				       an ethernet NIC and must be up before
#				       Shorewall is started.
