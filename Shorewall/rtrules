# Shorewall version 3.2 - rtrules File
#
# /etc/shorewall/rtrules
#
#	Entries in this file cause traffic to be routed to one of the
#	providers listed in /etc/shorewall/providers.
#
#	Columns are:
#
#		SOURCE(optonal) An ip address (network or host) that
#				matches the source IP address in a packet.
#				May also be specified as an interface
#				name optionally followed by ":" and an
#				address. If the device 'lo' is specified,
#				the packet must originate from the firewall
#				itself.
#
#		DEST(optional)  An ip address (network or host) that
#				matches the destination IP address in a packet.
#
#				If you choose to omit either SOURCE or DEST,
#				place "-" in that column. Note that you
#				may not omit both SOURCE and DEST.
#
#		PROVIDER        The provider to route the traffic through.
#				May be expressed either as the provider name
#				or the provider number.
#
#		PRIORITY
#				The rule's priority which determines the order
#				in which the rules are processed.
#
#				1000-1999   Before Shorewall-generated
#					    'MARK' rules
#
#				11000- 11999 After 'MARK' rules but before
#					    Shorewall-generated rules for
#					    ISP interfaces.
#
#				26000-26999 After ISP interface rules but
#					    before 'default' rule.
#
#				Rules with equal priority are applied in
#				the order in which they appear in the file.
#
# Example: You want all traffic coming in on eth1 to be routed to the ISP1
#          provider:
#
#	#SOURCE			DEST		PROVIDER	PRIORITY
#	eth1	    		-		ISP1		1000
