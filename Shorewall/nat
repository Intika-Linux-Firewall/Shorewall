# Shorewall version 3.3 - Nat File
#
# /etc/shorewall/nat
#
#	This file is used to define one-to-one Network Address Translation
#	(NAT).
#
# WARNING: If all you want to do is simple port forwarding, do NOT use this
#	   file. See http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq1. Also, in most
#	   cases, Proxy ARP is a better solution that one-to-one NAT.
#
# Columns are:
#
#	EXTERNAL	External IP Address - this should NOT be the primary
#			IP address of the interface named in the next
#			column and must not be a DNS Name.
#
#                       If you put COMMENT in this column, the rest of the
#			line will be attached as a comment to the Netfilter
#			rule(s) generated by the next entry in the file.
#			The comment will appear delimited by "/* ... */"
#			in the output of "shorewall show nat"
#
#	INTERFACE	Interface that has the EXTERNAL address.
#			If ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes in shorewall.conf, Shorewall
#			will automatically add the EXTERNAL address to this
#			interface. Also if ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes, you may
#			follow the interface name with ":" and a digit to
#			indicate that you want Shorewall to add the alias
#			with this name (e.g., "eth0:0"). That allows you to
#			see the alias with ifconfig. THAT IS THE ONLY THING
#			THAT THIS NAME IS GOOD FOR -- YOU CANNOT USE IT
#			ANYWHERE ELSE IN YOUR SHORWALL CONFIGURATION.
#
#			If you want to override ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes for a
#			particular entry, follow the interface name with
#			":" and no digit (e.g., "eth0:").
#	INTERNAL	Internal Address (must not be a DNS Name).
#
#	ALL INTERFACES	If Yes or yes, NAT will be effective from all hosts.
#			If No or no (or left empty) then NAT will be effective
#			only through the interface named in the INTERFACE
#			column
#
#	LOCAL		If Yes or yes, NAT will be effective from the firewall
#			system
#
