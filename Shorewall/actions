# Shorewall version 3.3 - Actions File
#
# /etc/shorewall/actions
#
#	This file allows you to define new ACTIONS for use in rules
#	(/etc/shorewall/rules). You define the iptables rules to
#	be performed in an ACTION in
#	/etc/shorewall/action.<action-name>.
#
#	ACTION names should begin with an upper-case letter to
#	distinguish them from Shorewall-generated chain names and
#	they must meet the requirements of a Netfilter chain. If
#	you intend to log from the action then the name must be
#	no longer than 11 character in length. Names must also
#	meet the requirements for a Bourne Shell identifier (must
#	begin with a letter and be composed of letters, digits and
#	underscore characters).
#
# Please see http://shorewall.net/Actions.html for additional information.
