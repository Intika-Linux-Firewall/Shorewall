      <h1 align="center">Shorewall Troubleshooting</h1>
   

    
      <h3 align="Left">Check the Errata</h3>
    
      <p align="Left">Check the <a href="errata.htm">Shorewall Errata</a>
 to be sure   that there isn't an update that you are missing for your version
of the   firewall.</p>
    
      <h3 align="Left">Check the FAQs</h3>
    
      <p align="Left">Check the <a href="FAQ.htm">FAQs</a> for solutions to common problems.</p>
    

    
      <h3 align="Left">If the firewall fails to start</h3>
  
  If you
receive an error message when starting or restarting the firewall and you
can't determine the cause, then do the following:
  <ul>
    <li>shorewall debug start 2&gt; /tmp/trace</li>
    <li>Look at the /tmp/trace file and see if that helps you     determine what
the problem is.</li>
    <li>If you still can't determine what's wrong then see the
    <a href="support.htm">support page</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Your test environment</h3>
  <p>Many times when people have problems with Shorewall, the problem is 
  actually an ill-conceived test setup. Here are several popular snafus: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Port
          Forwarding where client and server are in the same subnet. See <a href="FAQ.htm">FAQ
          2.</a></li>
    <li>Changing the IP address of a local system to be in the external subnet, 
    thinking that Shorewall will suddenly believe that the system is in the 
    'net' zone.</li>
    <li>Multiple interfaces connected to the same HUB or Switch. Given the way 
    that the Linux kernel respond to ARP &quot;who-has&quot; requests, this type of setup 
    does NOT work the way that you expect it to.</li>
  </ul>
  
      <h3 align="Left">If you are having
connection problems:</h3>
    
      <p align="Left">If the appropriate policy for the connection that you
are trying to make is ACCEPT, please DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL ACCEPT RULES TRYING
TO MAKE IT WORK. Such additional rules will NEVER make it work, they add
clutter to your rule set and they represent a big security hole in the event
that you forget to remove them later.</p>
    
      <p align="Left">I also recommend against setting all of your policies to 
      ACCEPT in an effort to make something work. That robs you of one of your 
      best diagnostic tools - the &quot;Shorewall&quot; messages that Netfilter will 
      generate when you try to connect in a way that isn't permitted by your 
      rule set.</p>
    
      <p align="Left">Check your log. If you don't see Shorewall  messages,
then your problem is probably NOT a Shorewall problem. If you DO see packet
messages, it is an indication that you are missing one or more rules.</p>
  
      <p align="Left">While you are troubleshooting, it is a good idea to clear
      two variables in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf:</p>
  
      <p align="Left">LOGRATE=&quot;&quot;<br>
      LOGBURST=&quot;&quot;</p>
  
      <p align="Left">This way, you will see all of the log messages being
      generated (be sure to restart shorewall after clearing these variables).</p>
  
      <p align="Left">Example:</p>
  
  <font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
  
      <p align="Left"><font face="Courier">Jun 27 15:37:56 gateway kernel: 
      Shorewall:all2all:REJECT:IN=eth2 
OUT=eth1 SRC=192.168.2.2 DST=192.168.1.3 LEN=67 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=63 
ID=5805 DF PROTO=UDP SPT=1803 DPT=53 LEN=47</font></p>
  
     </font>
  
      <p align="Left">Let's look at the important parts of this message:</p>
   
  <ul>
    <li>all2all:REJECT - the packet was rejected under the     "all"-&gt;"all" REJECT
policy</li>
    <li>IN=eth2 - the packet entered the firewall via eth2</li>
    <li>OUT=eth1 - if accepted, the packet would be sent on eth1</li>
    <li>SRC=192.168.2.2 - the packet was sent by 192.168.2.2</li>
    <li>DST=192.168.1.3 - the packet is destined for 192.168.1.3</li>
    <li>PROTO=UDP - UDP Protocol</li>
    <li>DPT=53 - DNS</li>
  </ul>
  
      <p align="Left">In this case, 192.168.2.2 was in the "dmz" zone and 
192.168.1.3 is in the "loc" zone. I was missing the rule:</p>
 
      <p align="Left">ACCEPT    dmz    loc    udp    53</p>
  

    
      <h3 align="Left">Other Gotchas</h3>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Remember that Shorewall doesn't automatically allow ICMP     type 8 ("ping")
requests to be sent between zones. If you want     pings to be allowed between
zones, you need a rule of the form:<br>
     <br>
         ACCEPT    &lt;source     zone&gt;    &lt;destination zone&gt;   
icmp        echo-request<br>
     <br>
     The ramifications of this can be subtle. For example, if you have the 
    following in /etc/shorewall/nat:<br>
     <br>
         10.1.1.2    eth0        130.252.100.18<br>
     <br>
     and you ping 130.252.100.18, unless you have allowed icmp type 8 between
the     zone containing the system you are pinging from and the zone containing 
    10.1.1.2, the ping requests will be dropped. This is true even if you
have     NOT specified 'noping' for eth0 in /etc/shorewall/interfaces.</li>
    <li>If you specify "routefilter" for an interface,     that interface must be
up prior to starting the firewall.</li>
    <li>Is your routing correct? For example, internal systems usually need to 
    be configured with their default gateway set to the IP address of their 
    nearest firewall interface. One often overlooked aspect of routing is that 
    in order for two hosts to communicate, the routing between them must be set 
    up <u>in both directions.</u> So when setting up routing between <b>A</b> 
    and<b> B</b>, be sure to verify that the route from <b>B</b> back to <b>A</b> 
    is defined.</li>
    <li>Some versions of LRP (EigerStein2Beta for example) have a     shell with
broken variable expansion. <a href="ftp://ftp.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/ash.gz">
You     can get a corrected shell from the Shorewall Errata download site.</a>
    </li>
    <li>Do you have your kernel properly configured? <a href="kernel.htm">Click 
   here to see my kernel configuration.</a> </li>
    <li>Some features require the "ip" program. That     program is generally included
in the "iproute" package which should     be included with your distribution
(though many distributions don't install     iproute by     default). You
may also download the latest source tarball from <a href="ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing" target="_blank">
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing</a>
.</li>
    <li>If you have <u>any</u>   entry for a zone in /etc/shorewall/hosts then the
zone must be entirely   defined in /etc/shorewall/hosts unless you have 
    specified MERGE_HOSTS=Yes (Shorewall version 1.3.5 and later). For example, if
a zone has two interfaces but   only one interface has an entry in /etc/shorewall/hosts
then hosts attached to   the other interface will <u>not</u> be considered
part of the zone.</li>
    <li>Problems with NAT? Be sure that you let Shorewall add all     external addresses
to be use with NAT unless you have set <a href="Documentation.htm#Aliases">
ADD_IP_ALIASES</a>
=No     in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf.</li>
  </ul>
