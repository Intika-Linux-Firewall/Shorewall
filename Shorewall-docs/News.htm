<p>Problems Corrected:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The command "shorewall debug try &lt;directory&gt;" now correctly traces
the attempt.</li>
  <li>The INCLUDE directive now works properly in the zones file; previously,
INCLUDE in that file was ignored.</li>
  <li>/etc/shorewall/routestopped records with an empty second column are
no longer ignored.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>New Features:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ORIGINAL DEST column in a DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-] rule may now contain
a list of addresses. If the list begins with "!' then the rule will take
effect only if the original destination address in the connection request
does not match any of the addresses listed.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>6/15/2003 - Shorewall, Kernel 2.4.21 and iptables 1.2.8</b></p>
 
<p>The firewall at shorewall.net has been upgraded to the 2.4.21 kernel and 
iptables 1.2.8 (using the "official" RPM from netfilter.org). No problems 
have been encountered with this set of software. The Shorewall version is 
1.4.4b plus the accumulated changes for 1.4.5.<br>
 </p>
 
<p><b>6/8/2003 - Updated Samples</b></p>
   
<p>Thanks to Francesca Smith, the samples have been updated to Shorewall
version 1.4.4.</p>
   
<p><b>5/29/2003 - Shorewall-1.4.4b</b></p>
     
<p>Groan -- This version corrects a problem whereby the --log-level was not 
 being set when logging via syslog. The most commonly reported symptom was 
 that Shorewall messages were being written to the console even though console 
 logging was correctly configured per FAQ 16.<br>
   </p>
     
<p><b>5/27/2003 - Shorewall-1.4.4a</b></p>
      The Fireparse --log-prefix fiasco continues. Tuomo Soini has pointed
 out   that the code in 1.4.4 restricts the length of short zone names to
4 characters.   I've produced version 1.4.4a that restores the previous 5-character
 limit   by conditionally omitting the log rule number when the LOGFORMAT
doesn't  contain '%d'. <br>
           
<p><b>5/23/2003 - Shorewall-1.4.4</b></p>
       I apologize for the rapid-fire releases but since there is a potential 
  configuration  change required to go from 1.4.3a to 1.4.4, I decided to 
make  it a full release  rather than just a bug-fix release. <br>
       <br>

       <b>    New Features:<br>
       </b>       
<ol>
         <li>A REDIRECT- rule target has been added. This target behaves
for   REDIRECT  in the same way as DNAT- does for DNAT in that the Netfilter
nat   table REDIRECT  rule is added but not the companion filter table ACCEPT
rule.<br>
           <br>
         </li>
         <li>The LOGMARKER variable has been renamed LOGFORMAT and has been 
 changed   to a 'printf' formatting template which accepts three arguments 
 (the chain   name, logging rule number and the disposition). To use LOGFORMAT 
 with fireparse   (<a href="http://www.fireparse.com">http://www.fireparse.com</a>), 
 set it   as:<br>
        <br>
              LOGFORMAT="fp=%s:%d a=%s "<br>
        <br>
           <b>CAUTION: </b>/sbin/shorewall uses the leading part of the LOGFORMAT 
   string (up to but not including the first '%') to find log messages in 
the   'show log', 'status' and 'hits' commands. This part should not be omitted 
   (the LOGFORMAT should not begin with "%") and the leading part should be
  sufficiently unique for /sbin/shorewall to identify Shorewall messages.<br>
           <br>
         </li>
         <li>When logging is specified on a DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-] rule,
the   logging  now takes place in the nat table rather than in the filter
table.   This way,  only those connections that actually undergo DNAT or
redirection   will be logged.<br>
         </li>

         This version primarily corrects the documentation included in the
 .tgz   and  in the .rpm. In addition: <br>
                   
<ol>
           <li>(This change is in 1.4.3 but is not documented) If you are 
running    iptables 1.2.7a and kernel 2.4.20, then Shorewall will return reject
replies    as follows:<br>
             a) tcp - RST<br>
             b) udp - ICMP port unreachable<br>
             c) icmp - ICMP host unreachable<br>
             d) Otherwise - ICMP host prohibited<br>
          If you are running earlier software, Shorewall will follow it's 
traditional     convention:<br>
             a) tcp - RST<br>
             b) Otherwise - ICMP port unreachable</li>
           <li>UDP port 135 is now silently dropped in the common.def chain.
  Remember    that this chain is traversed just before a DROP or REJECT policy
  is enforced.<br>

            <li>The rules for allowing all traffic via the loopback interface

<ol>
                 <li>Where an entry in the/etc/shorewall/hosts file specifies 
  a  particular     host or network, Shorewall now creates an intermediate 
 chain  for handling     input from the related zone. This can substantially 
 reduce  the number of   rules traversed by connections requests from such 
 zones.<br>
                       <br>
                     </li>
                 <li>Any file may include an INCLUDE directive. An INCLUDE
 directive      consists  of the word INCLUDE followed by a file name and
causes the contents     of the  named file to be logically included into
the file containing the    INCLUDE.   File names given in an INCLUDE directive
are assumed to reside    in /etc/shorewall   or in an alternate configuration
 directory if one has    been specified for  the command. <br>

                 <li>Routing traffic from an interface back out that interface
   continues      to be a problem. While I firmly believe that this should
 never  happen,   people   continue to want to do it. To limit the damage
that such  nonsense   produces,   I have added a new 'routeback' option in
/etc/shorewall/interfaces    and /etc/shorewall/hosts.   When used in /etc/shorewall/interfaces,
the  'ZONE'   column may not contain   '-'; in other words, 'routeback' can't 
  be used as  an option for a multi-zone   interface. The 'routeback' option 
  CAN be specified  however on individual  group entries in /etc/shorewall/hosts.<br>
                  <br>
                 The 'routeback' option is similar to the old 'multi' option
  with   two   exceptions:<br>
                  <br>
                    a) The option pertains to a particular zone,interface,address 
    tuple.<br>
                  <br>
                    b) The option only created infrastructure to pass traffic 
  from   (zone,interface,address)    tuples back to themselves (the 'multi'

<ol>
                  <li>When Shorewall 1.4.0 is run under the ash shell (such 
 as  on  Bering/LEAF),     it can attempt to add ECN disabling rules even 
if the  /etc/shorewall/ecn     file is empty. That problem has been corrected
  so that ECN disabling rules     are only added if there are entries in
/etc/shorewall/ecn.</li>

<blockquote>Note: In the list that follows, the term <i>group </i>refers to
a particular network or subnetwork (which may be 0.0.0.0/0 or it may be a
host address) accessed through a particular interface. Examples:<br>

                   </blockquote>
                 You can use the "shorewall check" command to see the groups
  associated      with each of your zones.<br>

<ol>
                  <li>Beginning with Shorewall 1.4.1, if a zone Z comprises 
 more   than   one  group<i> </i>then if there is no explicit Z to Z policy 
 and there  are   no rules governing traffic from Z to Z then Shorewall will 
 permit   all  traffic   between the groups in the zone.</li>
                  <li>Beginning with Shorewall 1.4.1, Shorewall will never
 create    rules    to handle traffic from a group to itself.</li>
                  <li>A NONE policy is introduced in 1.4.1. When a policy 
of  NONE   is  specified   from Z1 to Z2:</li>

                  <li>There may be no rules created that govern connections 
 from   Z1  to  Z2.</li>
                  <li>Shorewall will not create any infrastructure to handle
  traffic     from   Z1 to Z2.</li>

 1.4   represents      the   next  step in the evolution of Shorewall. The 
 main  thrust of the   initial    release  is simply to remove the cruft that
 has  accumulated in   Shorewall   over time. <br>
                      <br>
                      <b>IMPORTANT: Shorewall 1.4.0 requires</b> <b>the iproute

 with  MERGE_HOSTS=Yes.<br>

                           <li>Shorewall 1.4 implements behavior consistent 
 with   OLD_PING_HANDLING=No.          OLD_PING_HANDLING=Yes will generate 
 an error   at startup as will specification          of the 'noping' or 'filterping'
   interface options.<br>

                           <li>In addition to behaving like OLD_PING_HANDLING=No, 
    Shorewall      1.4   no  longer unconditionally accepts outbound ICMP 
packets.    So if  you    want  to 'ping'  from the firewall, you will need 
the appropriate    rule or   policy.<br>

  to  shorewall.conf.         When     set to Yes, Shorewall ping handling 
 is as  it has always been     (see    http://www.shorewall.net/ping.html).<br>

  is  handled     via   rules    and   policies   just like any other connection
    request.   The  FORWARDPING=Yes      option   in shorewall.conf   and
the    'noping' and  'filterping'  options   in   /etc/shorewall/interfaces

it creates under    ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes        and  ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes.

    request.   The  FORWARDPING=Yes      option   in shorewall.conf   and
the    'noping' and  'filterping'  options   in   /etc/shorewall/interfaces

<ol>
                                        <li>A new 'DNAT-' action has been 
added    for   entries     in  the   /etc/shorewall/rules       file. DNAT- 
is intended     for advanced     users  who   wish to minimize the number 
     of rules   that  connection  requests   must traverse.<br>
                                          <br>
                                      A Shorewall DNAT rule actually generates
   two   iptables     rules:    a  header    rewriting  rule in the 'nat'
table   and   an ACCEPT   rule  in the    'filter'  table.    A DNAT-  rule
only  generates   the first   of these  rules.    This is handy when    you
have   several DNAT  rules that   would generate  the   same ACCEPT rule.<br>
                                          <br>
                                         Here are three rules from my previous
   rules    file:<br>
                                          <br>
                                              DNAT   net  dmz:206.124.146.177 
  tcp   smtp   -  206.124.146.178<br>
                                              DNAT   net  dmz:206.124.146.177 
  tcp   smtp   -  206.124.146.179<br>
                                              ACCEPT net  dmz:206.124.146.177 
  tcp   www,smtp,ftp,...<br>
                                          <br>
                                         These three rules ended up generating
   _three_     copies    of<br>
                                          <br>
                                               ACCEPT net  dmz:206.124.146.177
   tcp   smtp<br>
                                          <br>
                                         By writing the rules this way, I 
end   up  with   only   one   copy   of  the   ACCEPT   rule.<br>
                                          <br>
                                              DNAT-  net  dmz:206.124.146.177

                                        <li>The 'shorewall check' command 
now   prints    out   the   applicable      policy    between each pair of 
zones.<br>
                                          <br>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>A new CLEAR_TC option has been
 added    to  shorewall.conf.         If  this   option  is set to 'No' then
 Shorewall    won't clear the current        traffic  control   rules  during
 [re]start.    This setting is intended   for    use by people  that  prefer
 to configure    traffic shaping when the  network    interfaces come  up
rather  than  when   the firewall is started.  If that  is  what you want
to  do, set TC_ENABLED=Yes       and CLEAR_TC=No and do not  supply  an /etc/shorewall/tcstart 
   file.   That way,   your traffic  shaping  rules can still use the 'fwmark' 
 classifier     based on   packet marking  defined  in /etc/shorewall/tcrules.<br>
                                          <br>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>A new SHARED_DIR variable has 
been   added    that   allows    distribution       packagers to easily move 
the   shared  directory    (default    /usr/lib/shorewall).       Users should
  never have  a need to   change the  value  of this shorewall.conf     
 setting.<br>

                                           <li>"shorewall debug [re]start"
 now   turns    off   debugging      after    an  error     occurs. This
places   the point    of the   failure near     the end  of  the  trace 
rather   than up in the   middle  of it.</li>
                                           <li>"shorewall [re]start" has
been   speeded     up  by  more   than   40%   with    my   configuration.
Your  milage may   vary.</li>
                                           <li>A "shorewall show classifiers" 
  command     has   been   added    which    shows      the current packet 
 classification     filters.   The  output    from this    command    is 
 also added as a  separate   page   in "shorewall    monitor"</li>
                                           <li>ULOG (must be all caps) is 
now   accepted     as  a  valid    syslog    level     and   causes the subject 
  packets to   be  logged   using  the  ULOG target   rather     than   the 
  LOG target.  This  allows you  to run  ulogd  (available    from <a
 href="http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd">http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd</a>)
                       and log all Shorewall messages <a

                                           <li>If you are running a kernel
 that   has   a  FORWARD     chain    in  the   mangle      table ("shorewall
 show   mangle"    will show   you  the chains    in the   mangle  table),
     you   can set  MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN=Yes      in     <a

marking          input packets based on their destination  even when    you
 are using  Masquerading        or SNAT.</li>
                                           <li>I have cluttered up the /etc/shorewall

     variable     to      <a href="Documentation.htm#Conf">shorewall.conf</a>. 
     This variable     specifies           the syslog level at which packets 
   are  logged as a result    of entries     in   the   /etc/shorewall/rfc1918 
   file.  Previously, these   packets were  always     logged   at the 'info' 
   level.<br>

with   Blacklist      logging.     In  Beta   2,  if  BLACKLIST_LOG_LEVEL

   now   turns    off   debugging      after    an  error    occurs. This 
places   the  point   of the   failure near    the  end of   the  trace rather 
  than  up  in the   middle of  it.</li>
                                                <li>"shorewall [re]start"

 Your milage   may vary.</li>
                                                <li>A "shorewall show classifiers"
     command     has   been   added    which    shows    the current packet
  classification       filters.   The   output  from  this   command  is
 also  added as a separate       page in  "shorewall   monitor"</li>
                                                <li>ULOG (must be all caps) 
 is  now   accepted     as  a  valid    syslog    level    and  causes the 
 subject  packets  to be   logged  using the    ULOG target    rather    than
  the LOG target.  This  allows you  to run ulogd    (available  from   
      <a href="http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd">http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd</a>)
                       and log all Shorewall messages <a

kernel    that   has   a  FORWARD     chain    in  the   mangle    table
("shorewall    show  mangle"   will  show you    the chains    in  the  mangle
table),     you can set MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN=Yes        in shorewall.conf.
     This    allows for  marking  input packets based    on   their destination 
even     when  you are using  Masquerading  or SNAT.</li>

   <li>The     'icmp.def'      file   is  now   empty!    The   rules   
in  that   file       were   required       in      ipchains   firewalls
   but   are not   required    in   Shorewall.         Users   who have 
      ALLOWRELATED=No        in      <a href="Documentation.htm#Conf">shorewall.conf</a> 
     should       see     the     <a href="errata.htm#Upgrade">Upgrade Issues</a>.</li>
                                                                        
   <li>A    'FORWARDPING'        option    has   been   added    to     
    <a href="Documentation.htm#Conf">     shorewall.conf</a>.         The
effect             of  setting             this  variable to Yes is the same
    as         the effect    of  adding an   ACCEPT        rule   for ICMP
echo-request                in    <a
 href="shorewall_extension_scripts.htm">/etc/shorewall/icmpdef</a>.     
              Users                  who have such a rule in icmpdef are
   encouraged            to  switch to   FORWARDPING=Yes.</li>
                                                                        
   <li>The     loopback     CLASS    A  Network     (127.0.0.0/8)       
has   been   added      to  the     rfc1918        file.</li>
                                                                        
   <li>Shorewall        now   works    with   iptables     1.2.7</li>
                                                                        
   <li>The     documentation        and   web   site   no  longer    uses 
  FrontPage       themes.</li>

<p>I would like to thank John Distler for his valuable input regarding TCP
                                   SYN   and ICMP treatment in Shorewall.
That     input      has    led    to   marked       improvement      in 
 Shorewall     in the   last   two   releases.</p>

   <li>Empty      and   invalid     source    and   destination       qualifiers 
     are       now   detected    in     the    rules   file. It is a  good 
   idea to   use    the    'shorewall        check'   command    before  
  you  issue     a 'shorewall   restart'     command be  be   sure  that you
don't   have   any       configuration   problems         that  will prevent

            This     option facilitates Proxy ARP sub-netting as described

                                       Specifying the proxyarp option for
an   interface          causes       Shorewall          to   set      /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/&lt;interface&gt;/proxy_arp.</li>

<p>Last weekend, I installed the CVS Web package to provide brower-based
access   to the Shorewall CVS repository. Since then, I have had several
instances where   my server was almost unusable due to the high load generated
by website copying   tools like HTTrack and WebStripper. These mindless tools:</p>
                                                                        
                                                                        
                           
<ul>
                                                                        
   <li>Ignore      robot.txt      files.</li>
                                                                        
   <li>Recursively         copy   everything      that   they   find.</li>
                                                                        
   <li>Should      be  classified      as  weapons     rather    than   tools.</li>
                                                                        
                                                                    
</ul>
                                                                        
                                                                      
<p>These tools/weapons are particularly damaging when combined with CVS Web
                                     because they doggedly follow every link
   in   the    cgi-generated              HTML     resulting      in   1000s
   of executions      of the cvsweb.cgi       script.       Yesterday,  
  I  spend  several     hours   implementing   measures    to block     
these    tools  but   unfortunately,       these    measures     resulted
    in  my   server    OOM-ing under   even      moderate load.</p>
                                                                        
                                                                        
                           
<p>Until I have the time to understand the cause of the OOM (or until I buy
                                     more RAM if that is what is required),
  CVS    Web    access       will     remain       Password        Protected.

  policy. These     previous    versions      optimized       away  the "all2<i>&lt;zone&gt;</i>"

                                     samples</a> have allowed people to get
  a  firewall         up   and    running        quickly,       they   have
  unfortunately     set    the  wrong   level    of expectation        among
  those      who   have  used      them.  I am  therefore    withdrawing

       This     command  attempts      "shorewall  -c     <i>       &lt;configuration
    directory&gt;</i>            start" and if   that  results      in the

     command    is executed.  The       'try'  command      allows you to
create   a new       <a href="Documentation.htm#Configs">    configuration</a>
      and  attempt        to start    it; if there is an error that leaves
      your    firewall      in the   stopped state,    it will automatically
  be restarted      using         the  default   configuration (in   /etc/shorewall).</li>

                                   to the previously-released samples. There
   are    two    new    rules      added:</p>

      (tcp     port   113)   to your     firewall,    these     connections
  will be   REJECTED        rather    than   DROPPED.   This     speeds 
up connection      establishment       to   some servers.</li>

  <li>    Previous          versions         of       Shorewall have an implementation
   of Static      NAT   which      violates     the           principle 
    of least surprise.        NAT only occurs  for   packets      arriving
     at  (DNAT) or      send     from (SNAT) the interface  named    in the
     INTERFACE     column   of     /etc/shorewall/nat. Beginning  with  
version      1.1.6,   NAT    effective        regardless      of which interface
   packets  come from  or are    destined     to. To get     compatibility
 with    prior versions,     I have  added       a new "ALL <a
 href="NAT.htm#AllInterFaces">"ALL     INTERFACES"       column     to  /etc/shorewall/nat</a>.
            By placing     "no" or  "No"  in   the new column,      the NAT
  behavior      of     prior   versions  may  be retained. </li>

through the tunnel.    Shorewall    will   now  create     this rule automatically
