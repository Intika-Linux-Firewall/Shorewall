    <title>ftwall</title>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall version 1.4.8, Shorewall can interface to
    ftwall. <emphasis role="bold">ftwall</emphasis> is part of the p2pwall
    project and is a user-space filter for applications based on the &#34;Fast
    Track&#34; peer to peer protocol. Applications using this protocol include
    Kazaa, KazaaLite, iMash and Grokster.</para>

    <para>To filter traffic from your &#39;loc&#39; zone with ftwall, you
    insert the following rules <emphasis role="bold">near the top</emphasis>
    of your /etc/shorewall/rules file (before and ACCEPT rules whose source is
    the &#39;loc&#39; zone).</para>

    <programlisting>QUEUE   loc        net        tcp
QUEUE   loc        net        udp
QUEUE   loc        fw         udp</programlisting>

    <para>Now simply configure ftwall as described in the ftwall documentation
    and restart Shorewall.</para>
