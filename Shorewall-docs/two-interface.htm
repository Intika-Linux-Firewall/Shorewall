<p align="left">Setting up a Linux system as a firewall for a small network
      is a  fairly straight-forward task if you understand the basics and
follow      the  documentation.</p>
                         
<p>This guide doesn't attempt to acquaint you with all of the features of
       Shorewall. It rather focuses on what is required to configure Shorewall
     in its  most common configuration:</p>
                         
<ul>
               <li>Linux system used as a firewall/router for a small local 
 network.</li>
               <li>Single public IP address.</li>
               <li>Internet connection through cable modem, DSL, ISDN, Frame
  Relay,    dial-up    ...</li>
                         
</ul>
                         
<p align="left">Here is a schematic of a typical installation.</p>
                         
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="images/basics.png" width="444"
 height="635">
            </p>
                         
<p><b>If you are running Shorewall under Mandrake 9.0 or later, you can easily
   configure the above setup using the Mandrake "Internet Connection Sharing"
   applet. From the Mandrake Control Center, select "Network &amp; Internet"
   then "Connection Sharing". You should not need to refer to this guide.</b><br>
      </p>
           
<p>This guide assumes that you have the iproute/iproute2 package installed
      (on  RedHat, the package is called <i>iproute</i>)<i>. </i>You can
tell     if  this  package is installed by the presence of an <b>ip</b> program
 on   your  firewall  system. As root, you can use the 'which' command to
check   for this  program:</p>
                         
<pre>     [root@gateway root]# which ip<br>     /sbin/ip<br>     [root@gateway root]#</pre>
                       
<p>I recommend that you first read through the  guide to familiarize yourself
      with what's involved then go back through it again  making your configuration
      changes. Points at which configuration changes are  recommended are
flagged      with <img border="0" src="images/BD21298_.gif" width="13"

                 If you edit your configuration files on a Windows system,
 you   must   save them as  Unix files if your editor supports that option
 or you   must  run them through  dos2unix before trying to use them. Similarly,
 if   you copy  a configuration file  from your Windows hard drive to a floppy
  disk, you must run dos2unix against the  copy before using it with Shorewall.</p>

         The configuration files for Shorewall are contained in the directory 
   /etc/shorewall -- for simple setups, you will only need to deal with a 
few  of  these as described in this guide.  After you have <a
 href="Install.htm">installed Shorewall</a>,  <b>download the <a
 href="/pub/shorewall/LATEST.samples/two-interfaces.tgz">two-interface sample</a>,
      un-tar it (tar -zxvf two-interfaces.tgz) and and copy the files to
/etc/shorewall        (these files will replace files with the same name).</b></p>
                         
<p>As each file is introduced, I suggest that you  look through the actual
      file on your system -- each file contains detailed  configuration instructions
      and default entries.</p>
                         
<p>Shorewall views the network where it is running as being composed of a
      set of  <i>zones.</i> In the two-interface sample configuration, the
 following     zone names are used:</p>

<p>Shorewall also recognizes the firewall system as its own zone - by default,
       the firewall itself is known as <b>fw.</b></p>
                         
<p>Rules about what traffic to allow and what traffic to deny are expressed

<p>For each connection request entering the firewall, the request is first
      checked against the  /etc/shorewall/rules file. If no rule in that
file     matches  the connection  request then the first policy in /etc/shorewall/policy
    that  matches the    request is applied. If that policy is REJECT or

<p align="left">The firewall has two network interfaces. Where Internet  connectivity
is through a cable or DSL "Modem", the <i>External Interface</i>  will be
the ethernet adapter that is connected to that "Modem" (e.g., <b>eth0</b>)  
      <u>unless</u> you connect via <i><u>P</u>oint-to-<u>P</u>oint <u>P</u>rotocol
       over <u>E</u>thernet</i> (PPPoE) or <i><u>P</u>oint-to-<u>P</u>oint
 <u>T</u>unneling     <u>P</u>rotocol </i>(PPTP) in which case the External
 Interface will be   a ppp  interface (e.g., <b>ppp0</b>). If you connect
via a regular modem,   your External  Interface will also be <b>ppp0</b>.
If you connect via ISDN,   your external  interface will be <b>ippp0.</b></p>

<p align="left">Your <i>Internal Interface</i> will be an ethernet adapter
      (eth1  or eth0) and will be connected to a hub or switch. Your other

<h2 align="left">IP Addresses</h2>
                         
<p align="left">Before going further, we should say a few words about Internet
       Protocol (IP) <i>addresses</i>. Normally, your ISP will assign you
a  single    <i> Public</i> IP address. This address may be assigned via
the<i>  Dynamic    Host  Configuration Protocol</i> (DHCP) or as part of
establishing  your  connection   when you dial in (standard modem) or establish
your PPP  connection.  In rare   cases, your ISP may assign you a<i> static</i>
IP address; that  means that  you  configure your firewall's external interface
 to use that  address permanently.<i>  </i>However your external address
is  assigned, it  will be shared by all of your systems when you access the
 Internet. You will have to assign your  own addresses in your  internal
network (the Internal  Interface on your firewall  plus your other  computers).
RFC 1918 reserves  several <i>Private </i>IP address ranges for this  purpose:</p>
                         
<div align="left">               
<pre>     10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255<br>     172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255<br>     192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255</pre>

<p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/BD21298_.gif" width="13"
 height="13">
                   Before starting Shorewall, you should look at the IP address 
   of  your  external    interface and if it is one of the above ranges, you
   should  remove  the    'norfc1918' option from the external interface's 
 entry  in    /etc/shorewall/interfaces.</p>
            </div>
                         
<div align="left">               
<p align="left">You will want to assign your addresses from the same <i> 
 sub-network </i>(<i>subnet)</i>.  For our purposes, we can consider a subnet
         to consists of a range of addresses x.y.z.0 - x.y.z.255. Such a
subnet       will    have a <i>Subnet Mask </i>of 255.255.255.0. The address
x.y.z.0     is  reserved as    the <i>Subnet Address</i> and x.y.z.255 is
reserved  as   the  <i>Subnet Broadcast</i>   <i>Address</i>. In Shorewall,
a subnet  is  described  using <a
 href="shorewall_setup_guide.htm#Subnets"><i>Classless  InterDomain Routing
 </i>(CIDR)  notation</a> with consists of the subnet  address followed 
  by "/24". The  "24" refers to the number of    consecutive  leading "1"

<h2 align="left">IP Masquerading (SNAT)</h2>
                         
<p align="left">The addresses reserved by RFC 1918 are sometimes referred
      to as <i>non-routable</i> because the Internet backbone routers don't
  forward    packets  which have an RFC-1918 destination address. When one
 of your local    systems  (let's assume computer 1) sends a connection request
  to an internet    host, the  firewall must perform <i>Network Address Translation
   </i>(NAT).    The firewall  rewrites the source address in the packet
to   be the address    of the firewall's  external interface; in other words,
 the firewall makes    it look as if the firewall  itself is initiating the
 connection.  This is   necessary so that the  destination host will be able
 to route return packets   back to the firewall  (remember that packets whose
 destination address is   reserved by RFC 1918 can't  be routed across the
 internet so the remote host  can't address its response to  computer 1).
When the firewall receives a return packet, it  rewrites the destination
address  back to 10.10.10.1  and  forwards the packet on to computer 1. </p>
                         
<p align="left">On Linux systems, the above process is often referred to
as<i>  IP Masquerading</i> but you will also see the term <i>Source Network
Address  Translation </i>(SNAT) used. Shorewall follows the convention used
with  Netfilter:</p>
                         
<ul>
               <li>                                                     
         
    <p align="left"><i>Masquerade</i> describes the case where you let your
         firewall system automatically detect the external interface address.
          </p>
              </li>
              <li>                                                      
        
    <p align="left"><i>SNAT</i> refers to the case when you explicitly specify
      the    source address that you want outbound packets from your local
 network     to use.    </p>
              </li>
                       
</ul>
                         
<p align="left">In Shorewall, both Masquerading and SNAT are configured with
       entries in the /etc/shorewall/masq file. You will normally use Masquerading
      if  your external IP is dynamic and SNAT if the IP is static.</p>
                         
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/BD21298_.gif" width="13"
 height="13">
                If your external firewall interface is <b>eth0</b>, you do
 not    need   to modify the file provided with the sample. Otherwise, edit
  /etc/shorewall/masq      and change the first column to the name of your
 external  interface and    the  second column to the name of your internal
 interface.</p>
                         
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/BD21298_.gif" width="13"
 height="13">
                If your external IP is  static, you can enter it in the third 
  column    in the /etc/shorewall/masq entry if  you like although your firewall 
  will    work fine if you leave that column empty.  Entering your static 
IP  in column    3 makes processing outgoing packets a little  more efficient.<br>

<h2 align="left">Port Forwarding (DNAT)</h2>
                         
<p align="left">One of your goals may be to run one or more servers on your
       local computers. Because these computers have RFC-1918 addresses,
it   is   not  possible for clients on the internet to connect directly to
them.   It   is rather  necessary for those clients to address their connection
requests     to the firewall  who rewrites the destination address to the
address of   your   server and forwards  the packet to that server. When
your server responds,     the firewall automatically  performs SNAT to rewrite
the source address   in  the response.</p>
                         
<p align="left">The above process is called<i> Port Forwarding</i> or <i> 
      Destination Network Address Translation</i> (DNAT). You configure port 
    forwarding using DNAT rules in the /etc/shorewall/rules file.</p>
                         
<p>The general  form of a simple port forwarding rule in  /etc/shorewall/rules

<ul>
               <li>You must test the above rule from a client outside of

               <li>Many ISPs block incoming connection requests to port 80. 
 If  you   have     problems connecting to your web server, try the following
  rule and  try     connecting to port 5000.</li>

<h2 align="left">Domain Name Server (DNS)</h2>
                         
<p align="left">Normally, when you connect to your ISP, as part of getting
      an IP  address your firewall's <i>Domain Name Service </i>(DNS) resolver
     will be  automatically configured (e.g., the /etc/resolv.conf file will
   be  written).  Alternatively, your ISP may have given you the IP address
  of a  pair of DNS <i> name servers</i> for you to manually configure as
your    primary  and secondary  name servers. Regardless of how DNS gets
configured    on your  firewall, it is <u>your</u> responsibility to configure
the resolver    in your   internal systems. You can take one of two approaches:</p>
                         
<ul>
               <li>                                                     
         
    <p align="left">You can configure your internal systems to use your ISP's
      name    servers. If you ISP gave you the addresses of their servers
or   if   those    addresses are available on their web site, you can configure
   your   internal    systems to use those addresses. If that information
isn't   available,   look in    /etc/resolv.conf on your firewall system
-- the name  servers are  given in    "nameserver" records in that file.
  </p>
              </li>
              <li>

                You can configure a<i> Caching Name Server </i>on your  
 firewall.<i>          </i>Red Hat has an RPM for a caching name server (the 
RPM also    requires    the 'bind' RPM) and for Bering users, there is dnscache.lrp.
 If you    take   this approach, you configure your internal systems to use
 the firewall    itself as their primary (and only) name server. You use
the  internal IP     address of the firewall (10.10.10.254 in the example
above)  for the name       server address. To allow your local systems to
talk to  your caching name      server, you must open port 53 (both UDP and
TCP) from  the local network   to the    firewall; you do that by adding
the following  rules in /etc/shorewall/rules.       </p>
