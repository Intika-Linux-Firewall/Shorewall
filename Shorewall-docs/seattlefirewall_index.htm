  width="90%"><h2>Site Problem</h2> The server that normally hosts
  www.shorewall.net and ftp.shorewall.net is currently down. Until it is back
  up, a small server with very limited bandwidth is being used temporarly. You
  will likely experience better response time from the <a
  href="http://shorewall.sourceforge.net" target="_top">Sourceforge site</a>
  or from one of the other <a href="shorewall_mirrors.htm">mirrors</a>. Sorry
  for the inconvenience.<br /> <br /> <h2>Introduction to Shorewall</h2>
  <h3>This is the Shorewall 1.4 Web Site</h3> The information on this site
  applies only to 1.4.x releases of Shorewall. For older versions:<br />
  <ul><li>The 1.3 site is <a href="http://www.shorewall.net/1.3" target="_top">here.</a></li><li>The
  1.2 site is <a href="http://shorewall.net/1.2/" target="_top">here</a>.</li></ul>
  <h3>Glossary</h3> <ul><li><a href="http://www.netfilter.org">Netfilter</a> -
  the packet filter facility built into the 2.4 and later Linux kernels.</li><li>ipchains
  - the packet filter facility built into the 2.2 Linux kernels. Also the name
  of the utility program used to configure and control that facility.
  Netfilter can be used in ipchains compatibility mode.</li><li>iptables - the
  utility program used to configure and control Netfilter. The term
  &#39;iptables&#39; is often used to refer to the combination of
  iptables+Netfilter (with Netfilter not in ipchains compatibility mode).</li></ul>
  <h3>What is Shorewall?</h3> The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as
  &#34;Shorewall&#34;, is high-level tool for configuring Netfilter. You
  describe your firewall/gateway requirements using entries in a set of
  configuration files. Shorewall reads those configuration files and with the
  help of the iptables utility, Shorewall configures Netfilter to match your
  requirements. Shorewall can be used on a dedicated firewall system, a
  multi-function gateway/router/server or on a standalone GNU/Linux system.
  Shorewall does not use Netfilter&#39;s ipchains compatibility mode and can
  thus take advantage of Netfilter&#39;s connection state tracking
  capabilities.<br /> <br /> Shorewall is <span
  style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> a daemon. Once Shorewall has
  configured Netfilter, it&#39;s job is complete although the <a
  href="starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm">/sbin/shorewall program can be
  used at any time to monitor the Netfilter firewall</a>.<br /> <h3>Getting

  <h2>News</h2> <p><b>12/07/2003 - Shorewall 1.4.9 Beta 1</b> <b><img
  alt="(New)" src="images/new10.gif"
  style="border: 0px solid ; width: 28px; height: 12px;" title="" /> </b></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><a

  <a href="ftp://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/Beta" target="_top">ftp://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/Beta</a>
  </div> <p>Problems Corrected since version 1.4.8:</p> <ol><li>There has been
  a low continuing level of confusion over the terms &#34;Source NAT&#34;
  (SNAT) and &#34;Static NAT&#34;. To avoid future confusion, all instances of
  &#34;Static NAT&#34; have been replaced with &#34;One-to-one NAT&#34; in the
  documentation and configuration files.</li><li>The description of NEWNOTSYN
  in shorewall.conf has been reworded for clarity.</li><li>Wild-card rules
  (those involving &#34;all&#34; as SOURCE or DEST) will no longer produce an
  error if they attempt to add a rule that would override a NONE policy. The
  logic for expanding these wild-card rules now simply skips those
  (SOURCE,DEST) pairs that have a NONE policy.</li></ol> <p>Migration Issues:<br />
  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; None.<br /> <br /> New Features: </p> <ol><li>To
  cut down on the number of &#34;Why are these ports closed rather than
  stealthed?&#34; questions, the SMB-related rules in
  /etc/shorewall/common.def have been changed from &#39;reject&#39; to
  &#39;DROP&#39;.</li><li>For easier identification, packets logged under the
  &#39;norfc1918&#39; interface option are now logged out of chains named
  &#39;rfc1918&#39;. Previously, such packets were logged under chains named
  &#39;logdrop&#39;.</li><li>Distributors and developers seem to be regularly
  inventing new naming conventions for kernel modules. To avoid the need to
  change Shorewall code for each new convention, the MODULE_SUFFIX option has
  been added to shorewall.conf. MODULE_SUFFIX may be set to the suffix for
  module names in your particular distribution. If MODULE_SUFFIX is not set in
  shorewall.conf, Shorewall will use the list &#34;o gz ko o.gz&#34;.<br />
  <br /> To see what suffix is used by your distribution:<br /> <br /> ls
  /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter<br /> <br /> All of the
  files listed should have the same suffix (extension). Set MODULE_SUFFIX to
  that suffix.<br /> <br /> Examples:<br /> <br />
  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; If all files end in &#34;.kzo&#34; then set
  MODULE_SUFFIX=&#34;kzo&#34;<br /> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; If all
  files end in &#34;.kz.o&#34; then set MODULE_SUFFIX=&#34;kz.o&#34;</li><li>Support
  for user defined rule ACTIONS has been implemented through two new files:<br />
  <br /> /etc/shorewall/actions - used to list the user-defined ACTIONS.<br />
  /etc/shorewall/action.template - For each user defined &#60;action&#62;,
  copy this file to /etc/shorewall/action.&#60;action&#62; and add the
  appropriate rules for that &#60;action&#62;. Once an &#60;action&#62; has
  been defined, it may be used like any of the builtin ACTIONS (ACCEPT, DROP,
  etc.) in /etc/shorewall/rules.<br /> <br /> Example: You want an action that
  logs a packet at the &#39;info&#39; level and accepts the connection.<br />
  <br /> In /etc/shorewall/actions, you would add:<br /> <br />
  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; LogAndAccept<br /> <br /> You would then
  copy /etc/shorewall/action.template to /etc/shorewall/LogAndAccept and in
  that file, you would add the two rules:<br />
  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; LOG:info<br />
  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; ACCEPT<br />
  <br /></li></ol> <p><b>12/03/2003 - Support Torch Passed</b> <b><img

  Effective today, I am reducing my participation in the day-to-day support of
  Shorewall. As part of this shift to community-based Shorewall support a new
  <a href="https://lists.shorewall.net/mailman/listinfo/shorewall-newbies">Shorewall
  Newbies mailing list</a> has been established to field questions and
  problems from new users. I will not monitor that list personally. I will
  continue my active development of Shorewall and will be available via the
  development list to handle development issues -- Tom. <p><b>11/07/2003 -
  Shorewall 1.4.8</b><b><br /> <br /> </b> Problems Corrected since version
  1.4.7:<br /> </p> <ol><li>Tuomo Soini has supplied a correction to a problem
  that occurs using some versions of &#39;ash&#39;. The symptom is that
  &#34;shorewall start&#34; fails with:<br /> &#x00A0;<br /> &#x00A0;&#x00A0;
  local: --limit: bad variable name<br /> &#x00A0;&#x00A0; iptables v1.2.8:
  Couldn&#39;t load match `-j&#39;:/lib/iptables/libipt_-j.so:<br />
  &#x00A0;&#x00A0; cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br />
  &#x00A0;&#x00A0; Try `iptables -h&#39; or &#39;iptables --help&#39; for more
  information.</li><li>Andres Zhoglo has supplied a correction that avoids
  trying to use the multiport match iptables facility on ICMP rules.<br />
  &#x00A0;<br /> &#x00A0;&#x00A0; Example of rule that previously caused
  &#34;shorewall start&#34; to fail:<br /> &#x00A0;<br />
  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;
  ACCEPT&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; loc&#x00A0; $FW&#x00A0;
  icmp&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; 0,8,11,12<br /> <br /></li><li>Previously, if
  the following error message was issued, Shorewall was left in an
  inconsistent state.<br /> &#x00A0;<br /> &#x00A0;&#x00A0; Error: Unable to
  determine the routes through interface xxx<br /> <br /></li><li>Handling of
  the LOGUNCLEAN option in shorewall.conf has been corrected.</li><li>In
  Shorewall 1.4.2, an optimization was added. This optimization involved
  creating a chain named &#34;&#60;zone&#62;_frwd&#34; for most zones defined
  using the /etc/shorewall/hosts file. It has since been discovered that in
  many cases these new chains contain redundant rules and that the
  &#34;optimization&#34; turns out to be less than optimal. The implementation
  has now been corrected.</li><li>When the MARK value in a tcrules entry is
  followed by &#34;:F&#34; or &#34;:P&#34;, the &#34;:F&#34; or &#34;:P&#34;
  was previously only applied to the first Netfilter rule generated by the
  entry. It is now applied to all entries.</li><li>An incorrect comment
  concerning Debian&#39;s use of the SUBSYSLOCK option has been removed from
  shorewall.conf.</li><li>Previously, neither the &#39;routefilter&#39;
  interface option nor the ROUTE_FILTER parameter were working properly. This
  has been corrected (thanks to Eric Bowles for his analysis and patch). The
  definition of the ROUTE_FILTER option has changed however. Previously,
  ROUTE_FILTER=Yes was documented as enabling route filtering on all
  interfaces (which didn&#39;t work). Beginning with this release, setting
  ROUTE_FILTER=Yes will enable route filtering of all interfaces brought up
  while Shorewall is started. As a consequence, ROUTE_FILTER=Yes can coexist
  with the use of the &#39;routefilter&#39; option in the interfaces file.</li><li>If
  MAC verification was enabled on an interface with a /32 address and a
  broadcast address then an error would occur during startup.</li><li>he NONE
  policy&#39;s intended use is to suppress the generating of rules that
  can&#39;t possibly be traversed. This means that a policy of NONE is
  inappropriate where the source or destination zone is $FW or &#34;all&#34;.
  Shorewall now generates an error message if such a policy is given in
  /etc/shorewall/policy. Previously such a policy caused &#34;shorewall
  start&#34; to fail.</li><li>The &#39;routeback&#39; option was broken for
  wildcard interfaces (e.g., &#34;tun+&#34;). This has been corrected so that
  &#39;routeback&#39; now works as expected in this case.<br /></li></ol>
  Migration Issues:<br /> <ol><li>The definition of the ROUTE_FILTER option in
  shorewall.conf has changed as described in item 8) above.<br /></li></ol>
  New Features:<br /> <ol><li>A new QUEUE action has been introduced for
  rules. QUEUE allows you to pass connection requests to a user-space filter
  such as ftwall (http://p2pwall.sourceforge.net). The ftwall program allows
  for effective filtering of p2p applications such as Kazaa. For example, to
  use ftwall to filter P2P clients in the &#39;loc&#39; zone, you would add
  the following rules:<br /> <br /> &#x00A0;&#x00A0; QUEUE&#x00A0;&#x00A0;
  loc&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;
  net&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; tcp<br /> &#x00A0;&#x00A0; QUEUE&#x00A0;&#x00A0;
  loc&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;
  net&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; udp<br /> &#x00A0;&#x00A0; QUEUE&#x00A0;&#x00A0;
  loc&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;
  fw&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0; udp<br /> <br /> You would normally want
  to place those three rules BEFORE any ACCEPT rules for loc-&#62;net udp or
  tcp.<br /> <br /> Note: When the protocol specified is TCP (&#34;tcp&#34;,
  &#34;TCP&#34; or &#34;6&#34;), Shorewall will only pass connection requests
  (SYN packets) to user space. This is for compatibility with ftwall.</li><li>A
  BLACKLISTNEWNONLY option has been added to shorewall.conf. When this option
  is set to &#34;Yes&#34;, the blacklists (dynamic and static) are only
  consulted for new connection requests. When set to &#34;No&#34; (the default
  if the variable is not set), the blacklists are consulted on every packet.<br />
  <br /> Setting this option to &#34;No&#34; allows blacklisting to stop
  existing connections from a newly blacklisted host but is more expensive in
  terms of packet processing time. This is especially true if the blacklists
  contain a large number of entries.</li><li>Chain names used in the
  /etc/shorewall/accounting file may now begin with a digit ([0-9]) and may
  contain embedded dashes (&#34;-&#34;).</li></ol> <p><b>10/26/2003 -
