<p>  Shorewall views the network in which it is running as a set of     
 <i> zones. </i>Shorewall itself defines exactly   one zone called "fw" which
  refers to the firewall system itself . The   /etc/shorewall/zones file
is   used to define additional zones and the example file   provided with
Shorewall   defines the zones:</p>
               
<ol>
             <li>  net -- the (untrusted) internet.</li>
             <li>  dmz - systems that must be accessible from       the internet
  and from the local network.  These systems cannot be trusted completely
since  their servers may have been       compromised through a security exploit.</li>
             <li>  loc - systems in your local network(s).       These systems
  must be protected from the internet and from the DMZ and in       some
cases,   from each other.</li>
               
</ol>
          
<p><b>Note: </b><a href="#Conf">You can specify the name of the firewall
zone</a>.  For ease of description in this documentation, it is assumed 
that the firewall zone is named "fw".</p>
          
<p>It can't be stressed enough that  with the exception of the firewall zone,
  Shorewall itself attaches no meaning to  zone names. Zone names are simply
  labels used to refer to a collection of  network hosts.</p>
          
<p>While zones are normally disjoint (no two zones have a host in common), 
   there are cases where nested or overlapping zone definitions are appropriate.</p>
          
<p>Netfilter has the concept of <i>tables</i> and <i>chains. </i>For the purpose
of this document, we will consider Netfilter to have three tables:</p>
     
<ol>
     <li>Filter table -- this is the main table for packet filtering and
can  be displayed with the command "shorewall show".</li>
     <li>Nat table -- used for all forms of Network Address Translation (NAT); 
 SNAT, DNAT and MASQUERADE.</li>
     <li>Mangle table -- used to modify fields in the packet header.<br>
     </li>
     
</ol>
     
<p>Netfilter defines a number of inbuilt chains: PREROUTING, INPUT, OUTPUT, 
 FORWARD and POSTROUTING. Not all inbuilt chains are present in all tables 
 as shown in this table.<br>
   </p>

<p>Shorewall doesn't create rules in all of the builtin chains. In the large 
 diagram below are boxes such as  shown below.  This box represents in INPUT 
 chain and shows that packets first flow through the INPUT chain in the Mangle 
 table followed by the INPUT chain in the Filter table. The parentheses around 
 "Mangle" indicate that while the packets will flow through the INPUT chain 
 in the Mangle table, Shorewall does not create any rules in that chain.<br>

<p>Here is a picture of how packets traverse the various chains and tables
  in Netfilter. In that diagram, "Local Process" refers to a process running

   In the text that follows, the paragraph numbers correspond to the box
number  in the diagram above.<br>
   </p>
     
<ol>
     <li>Packets entering the firewall first pass through the <i>mangle </i>table's 
   PREROUTING chain (you can see the mangle table by typing "shorewall show 
   mangle"). If the packet entered through an interface that has the <b>norfc1918</b> 
   option and if iptables/netfilter doesn't support the connection tracking 
match extension, then the packet is sent down the <b>man1918</b> chain which 
will  drop  the packet if its destination IP address is reserved (as specified
 in the  /etc/shorewall/rfc1918 file). Next the packet passes through the<b>
 pretos</b>  chain to set its TOS field as specified in the /etc/shorewall/tos
 file.  Finally, if traffic control/shaping is being used, the packet is
sent  through  the<b> tcpre</b> chain to be marked for later use in policy
routing  or traffic  control.<br>
       <br>
   Next, if the packet isn't part of an established connection, it passes 
  through the<i> nat</i> table's PREROUTING chain (you can see the nat table
  by  typing "shorewall show nat"). If you are doing both static nat and
 port  forwarding, the order in which chains are traversed is dependent on
the  setting of NAT_BEFORE_RULES in shorewall.conf. If NAT_BEFORE_RULES is
on then  packets will ender a chain called<b> <i>interface_</i>in</b> where
    <i>interface</i>  is  the name of the interface on which the packet entered.
 Here it's destination  IP  is compared to each of the <i>EXTERNAL</i> IP
addresses from /etc/shorewall/nat   that correspond to this interface; if
there is a match, DNAT is applied  and the  packet header is modified to
the IP in the <i>INTERNAL</i> column  of the nat  file record. If the destination
address doesn't match any of the rules in the  <b><i>interface_</i>in</b>
chain then the packet enters a chain  called <b><i>sourcezone</i>_dnat</b>
 where <i>sourcezone</i> is the source zone of the packet. There it is compared
 for a match against each of the DNAT records in the rules file that specify
    <i>  sourcezone     </i>as the source  zone. If a match is found, the
destination IP  address (and possibly the destination port) is modified based
on the rule  matched. If NAT_BEFORE_RULES is off, then the order of traversal
of the <b><i>  interface_</i>in</b> and <b><i>sourcezone</i>_dnat</b>  is
reversed.<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>Depending on whether the packet is destined for the firewall itself 
 or for another system, it follows either the left or the right path. Traffic 
 going to the firewall goes through chain called INPUT in the mangle table. 
 Shorewall doesn't add any rules to that chain.<br>
     <br>
   </li>
   <li>Traffic that is to be forwarded to another host goes through the chains 
called FORWARD in the mangle table. If MARK_IN_FORWARD=Yes in shorewall.conf, 
all rules in /etc/shorewall/tcrules that do not specify Prerouting (:P) are 
processed in a chain called <br>
     <br>
   </li>
   
  <ol>
                 
  </ol>
     <li>Traffic is next sent to an<i> interface </i>chain in the main Netfilter
  table  (called 'filter'). If the traffic is destined for the  firewall
itself,   the name of the interface chain is formed by appending "_in" to
 the interface   name. So traffic on eth0 destined for the firewall will
enter a  chain called       <i>eth0_in</i>. The interface chain for traffic
that will be routed to  another  system is formed by appending "_fwd" to
the interface name. So traffic  from  eth1 that is going to be forwarded
enters a chain called<i> eth1_fwd</i>.    Interfaces described with the wild-card
character ("+") in  /etc/shorewall/interfaces,  share input chains. if <i>ppp+
    </i>appears in  /etc/shorewall/interfaces then all PPP interfaces (ppp0,
ppp1, ...) will share  the interface chains <i>ppp_in</i>  and <i>ppp_fwd</i>.
In other words, "+" is  deleted from the name before forming the input chain
names.<br>
     <br>
 While the use of interfacechains may seem wasteful in simple environments,
  in  complex setups it substantially reduces the number of rules that each
  packet  must traverse.  </li>
     
</ol>
                                         
<p>  Traffic directed from a zone to the firewall itself is sent through
a chain named &lt;<i>zone name&gt;</i>2fw. For example, traffic inbound from 
  the   internet and addressed to the firewall is sent through a chain named 
  net2fw.   Similarly, traffic originating in the firewall and being sent 
to  a host in a   given zone is sent through a chain named fw2<i>&lt;zone 
name&gt;.        </i>For   example, traffic originating in the firewall and 
destined  for a host in the   local network is sent through a chain named 
<i>fw2loc.</i>        <font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica">   </font></p>
               
<p>  Traffic being forwarded between two zones (or from one interface to
a zone to another interface to that zone) is sent through a chain named <i> 
  &lt;source   zone&gt;</i>2<i> &lt;destination zone&gt;</i>. So for example, 
  traffic   originating in a local system and destined for a remote web server 
  is   sent through chain       <i>loc2net. </i>This chain is referred to 
as the <i>canonical</i>    chain from &lt;source zone&gt; to &lt;destination 
  zone&gt;. Any destination NAT will have occurred <u>before</u>   the packet 
  traverses one of these chains so rules in /etc/shorewall/rules   should 
be  expressed in terms of the destination system's real IP address as   opposed 
  to its apparent external address. Similarly, source NAT will occur <u>after</u> 
      the packet has traversed the appropriate forwarding chain so the rules 
  again   will be expressed using the source system's real IP address.</p>
               
<p>  For each record in the /etc/shorewall/policy file, a chain is   created.
  Policies in that file are expressed in terms of a source zone and   destination
  zone where these zones may be a zone defined in   /etc/shorewall/zones,
"fw"  or "all". Policies specifying   the pseudo-zone "all" matches all defined
  zones and "fw".   These chains are referred to as <i>Policy Chains.</i> Notice
  that for an   ordered pair of zones (za,zb), the canonical chain (za2zb)
 may also be the    policy chain for the pair or the policy chain may be
a  different chain   (za2all, for example). Packets from one zone to another
 will traverse chains    as follows:</p>
               
<ol>
             <li>  If the canonical chain exists, packets first traverse
that   chain.</li>
             <li>  If the canonical chain and policy chain are different
and   the packet    does not match a rule in the canonical chain, it then
is sent   to the      policy chain.</li>
             <li>  If the canonical chain does not exist, packets are sent
 immediately    to the policy chain.</li>
               
</ol>
               
<p>  The canonical chain from zone za to zone zb will be created only if
there are   exception rules defined in /etc/shorewall/rules for packets going
from za to   zb.</p>
               
<p>  Shorewall is built on top of the Netfilter kernel facility. Netfilter 
  implements connection tracking function that allow what is often referred 
  to   as "statefull inspection" of packets. This statefull property allows 
    firewall rules to be defined in terms of "connections" rather than   in
  terms of "packets". With Shorewall, you:</p>
               
<ol>
             <li>  Identify the client's zone.</li>
             <li>  Identify the server's zone.</li>
             <li>  If the POLICY from the client's zone to the server's zone
  is what you     want for this client/server pair, you need do nothing further.</li>
             <li>  If the POLICY is not what you want, then you must add
a  rule.  That rule       is expressed in terms of the client's zone and
the  server's  zone.</li>
               
</ol>
               
<p>  Just because connections of a particular type are allowed between zone
  A   and the firewall and are also allowed between the firewall and zone
B  <font color="#ff6633"><b><u>   DOES   NOT mean that these connections
are  allowed between zone A and zone  B</u></b></font>.   It rather means
that  you can have a proxy running on the firewall that accepts   a connection
 from zone A and then establishes its own separate connection from   the
firewall   to zone B.</p>
               
<p>  If you adopt the default policy of ACCEPT from the local zone to the
    internet zone and you are having problems connecting from a local client
  to an   internet server, <font color="#ff6633"><b><u> adding a rule won't
  help</u></b></font>     (see point 3 above).</p>
