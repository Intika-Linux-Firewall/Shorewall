  <title>Shorewall 1.4.9</title>

  <section>
    <title>Problems Corrected</title>

    <para>These are the problems corrected since Shorewall 1.4.8</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>There has been a low continuing level of confusion over the
        terms &#34;Source NAT&#34; (SNAT) and &#34;Static NAT&#34;. To avoid
        future confusion, all instances of &#34;Static NAT&#34; have been
        replaced with &#34;One-to-one NAT&#34; in the documentation and
        configuration files.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The description of NEWNOTSYN in shorewall.conf has been reworded
        for clarity.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Wild-card rules (those involving &#34;all&#34; as SOURCE or
        DEST) will no longer produce an error if they attempt to add a rule
        that would override a NONE policy. The logic for expanding these
        wild-card rules now simply skips those (SOURCE,DEST) pairs that have a
        NONE policy.</para>
      </listitem>

    <para>None.</para>

  <section>
    <title>New Features</title>

    <para>These are the new features added since Shorewall 1.4.8</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>To cut down on the number of &#34;Why are these ports closed
        rather than stealthed?&#34; questions, the SMB-related rules in
        /etc/shorewall/common.def have been changed from &#39;reject&#39; to
        &#39;DROP&#39;.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>For easier identification, packets logged under the
        &#39;norfc1918&#39; interface option are now logged out of chains
        named &#39;rfc1918&#39;. Previously, such packets were logged under
        chains named &#39;logdrop&#39;.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Distributors and developers seem to be regularly inventing new
        naming conventions for kernel modules. To avoid the need to change
        Shorewall code for each new convention, the MODULE_SUFFIX option has
        been added to shorewall.conf. MODULE_SUFFIX may be set to the suffix
        for module names in your particular distribution. If MODULE_SUFFIX is
        not set in shorewall.conf, Shorewall will use the list &#34;o gz ko
        o.gz&#34;. To see what suffix is used by your distribution:</para>

        <programlisting>ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter</programlisting>

        <para>All of the files listed should have the same suffix (extension).
        Set MODULE_SUFFIX to that suffix. Examples:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>If all files end in &#34;.kzo&#34; then set
            MODULE_SUFFIX=&#34;kzo&#34;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>If all files end in &#34;.kz.o&#34; then set
            MODULE_SUFFIX=&#34;kz.o&#34;</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Support for user defined rule ACTIONS has been implemented
        through two new files: <itemizedlist><listitem><para>/etc/shorewall/actions
        - used to list the user-defined ACTIONS.</para></listitem><listitem><para>/etc/shorewall/action.template
        - For each user defined &#60;action&#62;:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>copy
        this file to /etc/shorewall/action.&#60;action&#62;</para></listitem><listitem><para>Add
        the appropriate rules in that file for the &#60;action&#62;.</para></listitem></orderedlist></listitem></itemizedlist>Once
        an &#60;action&#62; has been defined, it may be used like any of the
        builtin ACTIONS (ACCEPT, DROP, etc.) in /etc/shorewall/rules. </para>

        <para>Example: You want an action that logs a packet at the
        &#39;info&#39; level and accepts the connection. </para>

        <para>In /etc/shorewall/actions, you would add: </para>

        <simplelist>
          <member>LogAndAccept</member>
        </simplelist>

        <para>You would then copy /etc/shorewall/action.template to
        /etc/shorewall/action.LogAndAccept and in that file, you would add the
        two rules: </para>

        <simplelist>
          <member>LOG:info</member>

          <member>ACCEPT</member>
        </simplelist>
      </listitem>
