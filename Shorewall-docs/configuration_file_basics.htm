       using DNS names in Shorewall configuration files. If you use DNS names

<p align="left">Beginning with Shorwall 1.3.9, Host addresses in Shorewall
       configuration files may be specified as either IP addresses or DNS
  Names.<br>
               <br>
              DNS names in iptables rules  aren't nearly as useful as they
 first    appear.    When a DNS name appears in a rule,  the iptables utility
 resolves    the name    to one or more IP addresses and inserts  those addresses
 into    the rule.  So  changes in the DNS-&gt;IP address relationship  that
 occur   after the firewall    has started have absolutely no effect on the
  firewall's   ruleset.    </p>
                           
<p align="left">     If your firewall rules include DNS names then:</p>
                                
<ul>
                <li>If your /etc/resolv.conf is wrong then your firewall

                <li>If your /etc/nsswitch.conf is wrong then your firewall
 won't        start.</li>
                <li>If your Name Server(s) is(are) down then your firewall
 won't        start.</li>
                <li>If your startup scripts try to start your firewall before 
  starting     your DNS server then your firewall won't start.<br>
               </li>
                <li>Factors totally outside your control (your ISP's router 
 is      down   for example), can prevent your firewall from starting.</li>
               <li>You must bring up your network interfaces prior to starting
   your   firewall.<br>
               </li>

<p>Where specifying an IP address, a subnet or an interface, you can    
   precede the item with "!" to specify the complement of the item. For 
      example, !192.168.1.4 means "any host but 192.168.1.4". There must
be no white space following the "!".</p>

                       <li>If you use line continuation to break a comma-separated
     list,   the          continuation line(s) must begin in column 1 (or
there     would  be embedded          white space)</li>

<h2><a name="Ports"></a>Port Numbers/Service Names</h2>
                                           
<p>Unless otherwise specified, when giving a port number you can use

<p>If you need to specify a range of ports, the proper syntax is &lt;<i>low
              port number</i>&gt;:&lt;<i>high port number</i>&gt;. For example,
      if you want to forward the range of tcp ports 4000 through 4100 to
local      host 192.168.1.3, the entry in /etc/shorewall/rules is:<br>

<p>You may use the /etc/shorewall/params     file to set shell variables
  that you can then use in some of the other    configuration files.</p>
                                                       
<p>It is suggested that variable names begin with an upper case letter<font

<h2><a name="MAC"></a>Using MAC Addresses</h2>
                                           
<p>Media Access Control (MAC)        addresses can be used to specify packet
       source in several of the        configuration files. To use this feature,
       your kernel must have MAC        Address Match support (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MAC)
       included.</p>
                                   
<p>MAC addresses are 48 bits wide and each Ethernet Controller has a    
   unique MAC address.<br>
                     <br>
                     In GNU/Linux, MAC addresses are usually written as a 
series    of  6  hex numbers        separated by colons. Example:<br>
                     <br>

                     Because Shorewall uses colons as a separator for address 
  fields,     Shorewall requires        MAC addresses to be written in another 
  way. In   Shorewall, MAC addresses        begin with a tilde ("~") and consist
  of 6  hex numbers separated by        hyphens. In Shorewall, the MAC address
   in  the example above would be        written "~02-00-08-E3-FA-55".<br>
          </p>
                   
<p><b>Note: </b>It is not necessary to use the special Shorewall notation
     in the <a href="MAC_Validation.html">/etc/shorewall/maclist</a> file.<br>

<h2><a name="Levels"></a>Shorewall Configurations</h2>
                                   
<p>  Shorewall allows you to have configuration  directories other than /etc/shorewall.
       The <a href="starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm">shorewall start
and    restart</a>       commands allow you to specify an alternate configuration
   directory and    Shorewall will use the files in the alternate directory
  rather than the  corresponding  files in /etc/shorewall. The alternate
directory    need not contain a complete  configuration; those files not
in the alternate    directory  will be read from  /etc/shorewall.</p>
                                   
<p>  This facility permits you to easily create a test or temporary configuration
        by:</p>
                                   
<ol>
                       <li>  copying the files that need modification from
 /etc/shorewall       to a separate      directory;</li>
                       <li>  modify those files in the separate directory;
 and</li>
                       <li>  specifying the separate directory in a shorewall 
  start    or  shorewall     restart command (e.g., <i><b>shorewall -c /etc/testconfig
      restart</b></i>  ).</li>
                                   
</ol>
