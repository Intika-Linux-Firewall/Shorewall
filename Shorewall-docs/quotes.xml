        <para>&#34;I have fought with IPtables for untold hours. First I tried
        the SuSE firewall, which worked for 80% of what I needed. Then
        gShield, which also worked for 80%. Then I set out to write my own
        IPtables parser in shell and awk, which was a lot of fun but never got
        me past the &#34;hey, cool&#34; stage. Then I discovered Shorewall.
        After about an hour, everything just worked. I am stunned, and very
        grateful&#34; -- ES, Phoenix AZ, USA.</para>

        <para>&#34;The configuration is intuitive and flexible, and much
        easier than any of the other iptables-based firewall programs out
        there. After sifting through many other scripts, it is obvious that
        yours is the most well thought-out and complete one available.&#34; --

        <para>&#34;I just installed Shorewall after weeks of messing with
        ipchains/iptables and I had it up and running in under 20

        <para>&#34;My case was almost like [the one above]. Well. instead of
        &#39;weeks&#39; it was &#39;months&#39; for me, and I think I needed
        two minutes more:</para>

        <para>&#34;Never in my +12 year career as a sys admin have I witnessed
        someone so relentless in developing a secure, state of the art, safe
        and useful product as the Shorewall firewall package for no cost or

        <para>&#34;one time more to report, that your great shorewall in the
        latest release 1.2.9 is working fine for me with SuSE Linux 7.3! I now
        have 7 machines up and running with shorewall on several versions -
        starting with 1.2.2 up to the new 1.2.9 and I never have encountered
        any problems!&#34; -- SM, Germany</para>

        <para>&#34;Because our company has information which has been
        classified by the national government as secret, our security
        doesn&#39;t stop by putting a fence around our company. Information
        security is a hot issue. We also make use of checkpoint firewalls, but
        not all of the internet servers are guarded by checkpoint, some of
        them are running....Shorewall.&#34; -- Name withheld by request,

        <para>&#34;thanx for all your efforts you put into shorewall - this
        product stands out against a lot of commercial stuff iÂ´ve been working
        with in terms of flexibillity, quality &#38; support&#34; -- RM,

      <listitem>
        <para>&#34;I have never seen such a complete firewall package that is
        so easy to configure. I searched the Debian package system for
        firewall scripts and Shorewall won hands down.&#34; -- RG, Toronto</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>&#34;My respects... I&#39;ve just found and installed Shorewall
        1.3.3-1 and it is a wonderful piece of software. I&#39;ve just sent
        out an email to about 30 people recommending it. :-)</para>

        <para>While I had previously taken the time (maybe 40 hours) to really
        understand ipchains, then spent at least an hour per server
        customizing and carefully scrutinizing firewall rules, I&#39;ve got
        shorewall running on my home firewall, with rulesets and policies that
        I know make sense, in under 20 minutes.&#34; -- RP, Guatamala</para>
