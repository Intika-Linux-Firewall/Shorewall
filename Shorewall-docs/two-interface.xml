		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>
		Setting up a Linux system as a firewall for a small network is a fairly straight-forward task if you understand the basics and follow the documentation.
		</para>
		<para>
		This guide doesn't attempt to acquaint you with all of the features of Shorewall. It rather focuses on what is required to configure Shorewall in its most common configuration:

		<note>
			<title>Shorewall and <trademark>Mandrake</trademark> 9.0&#043;</title>
			<para>
			If you are running Shorewall under <trademark>Mandrake</trademark> 9.0 or later, you can easily configure the above setup using the <trademark>Mandrake</trademark> <quote>Internet Connection Sharing</quote> applet. From the <emphasis><interface>Mandrake Control Center</interface></emphasis>, select <quote><guimenuitem>Network</guimenuitem> &#038; <guisubmenu>Internet</guisubmenu></quote> then <quote><interface>Connection Sharing</interface></quote>.
			</para>
			<para>
			Note however, that the Shorewall configuration produced by <emphasis>Mandrake Internet Connection Sharing</emphasis> is strange and is apt to confuse you if you use the rest of this documentation (it has two local zones; <varname>loc</varname> and <varname>masq</varname> where <varname>loc</varname> is empty; this conflicts with this documentation which assumes a single local zone <varname>loc</varname>). We therefore recommend that once you have set up this sharing that you uninstall the <trademark>Mandrake</trademark> Shorewall RPM and install the one from the <ulink url="download.htm">download</ulink> page then follow the instructions in this Guide.
			</para>
		</note>
		<para>
		Shorewall requires that you have the <command>iproute</command>/<command>iproute2</command> package installed (on <trademark>RedHat</trademark>, the package is called <command>iproute</command>). You can tell if this package is installed by the presence of an <command>ip</command> program on your firewall system. As <literal>root</literal>, you can use the <command>which</command> command to check for this program:
		<programlisting>
[root@gateway root]# which ip
/sbin/ip
[root@gateway root]#
		</programlisting>
		I recommend that you first read through the guide to familiarize yourself with what's involved then go back through it again making your configuration changes.
		</para>
		<caution>
			<para>
			If you edit your configuration files on a <trademark>Windows</trademark> system, you must save them as <trademark>Unix</trademark> files if your editor supports that option or you must run them through <command>dos2unix</command> before trying to use them. Similarly, if you copy a configuration file from your <trademark>Windows</trademark> hard drive to a floppy disk, you must run <command>dos2unix</command> against the copy before using it with Shorewall.

		<title>PPTP/ADSL</title>
		<important>
			<para>
			If you have an <acronym>ADSL</acronym> Modem and you use <acronym>PPTP</acronym> to communicate with a server in that modem, you must make the changes recommended here in addition to those detailed below. <acronym>ADSL</acronym> with <acronym>PPTP</acronym> is most commonly found in Europe, notably in Austria.
