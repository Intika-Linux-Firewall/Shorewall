  <li><font size="3">"I have fought with IPtables for untold hours. First
I tried the SuSE firewall, which worked for 80% of what I needed. Then gShield, 
which also worked for 80%. Then I set out to write my own IPtables parser 
in shell and awk, which was a lot of fun but never got me past the "hey, cool"
stage. Then I discovered Shorewall. After about an hour, everything just
worked. I am stunned, and very grateful"</font> -- ES, Phoenix AZ, USA.<br>

  </li>
  <li>"The configuration is intuitive and flexible, and much easier than
any  of the other iptables-based firewall programs out there. After sifting
through  many other scripts, it is obvious that yours is the most well thought-out 
 and complete one available." -- BC, USA<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>"I just installed Shorewall after weeks of messing with       ipchains/iptables 
  and I had it up and running in under 20 minutes!"       -- JL, Ohio<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>"My case was almost like [the one above]. Well. instead of 'weeks'
it  was  'months' for me, and I think I needed two minutes more:<br>
  </li>
</ul>
           
<ul>
       
  <ul>
    <li>One to see that I had no Internet access from the firewall itself.</li>
  </ul>
       
  <ul>
    <li>Other to see that this was the default configuration, and it was 
enough  to uncomment a line in /etc/shorewall/policy.<br>
       </li>
  </ul>
      
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>     Minutes instead of months! Congratulations and thanks for such
a simple  and well documented thing for something as huge as iptables." --
JV, Spain.     </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>"I downloaded Shorewall 1.2.0 and installed it on Mandrake 8.1    
  without   any problems. Your documentation is great and I really appreciate
your  network configuration info. That really helped me out alot.       THANKS!!!"

  <li>"[Shorewall is a] great, great project. I've used/tested may      
firewall   scripts but this one is till now the best." -- B.R,       Netherlands
        </li>
</ul>
      
<ul>
  <li>"Never in my +12 year career as a sys admin have I witnessed      
someone   so relentless in developing a secure, state of the art, safe and
      useful   product as the Shorewall firewall package for no cost or obligation 
  involved." -- Mario Kerecki, Toronto           </li>
</ul>
      
<ul>
  <li>"one time more to report, that your great shorewall in the latest 
  release        1.2.9 is working fine for me with SuSE Linux 7.3! I now
have 7 machines  up       and running with shorewall on several versions
- starting with 1.2.2  up to       the new 1.2.9 and I never have encountered
any problems!" -- SM, Germany</li>
</ul>
      
<ul>
  <li>"You have the best support of any other package I've ever       used." 
  -- SE, US           </li>
</ul>
      
<ul>
  <li>"Because our company has information which has been classified by the 
 national government as secret, our security doesn't stop by putting a fence 
   around our company. Information security is a hot issue. We also make use
  of  checkpoint firewalls, but not all of the internet servers are guarded 
  by  checkpoint, some of them are running....Shorewall." -- Name withheld

</ul>
      
<ul>
  <li>"thanx for all your efforts you put into shorewall - this product stands 
  out  against a lot of commercial stuff i´ve been working with in terms of
   flexibillity, quality &amp; support" -- RM, Austria</li>
</ul>
      
<ul>
  <li>"I have never seen such a complete firewall package that is so easy
to    configure. I searched the Debian package system for firewall scripts
and    Shorewall won hands down." -- RG, Toronto</li>
</ul>
      
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>"My respects... I've just found and installed Shorewall 1.3.3-1 and
it   is a  wonderful piece of software. I've just sent out an email to about 
30  people  recommending it. :-)<br>
    <br>
While I had previously taken the time (maybe 40 hours) to really understand 
   ipchains, then spent at least an hour per server customizing and carefully 
   scrutinizing firewall rules, I've got shorewall running on my home firewall, 
   with rulesets and policies that I know make sense, in under 20 minutes."
