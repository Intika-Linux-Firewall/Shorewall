<h2>Problem Reporting Guidelines</h2>
    <i>"Let me see if I can translate your message into a real-world example. 
  It would be like saying that you have three rooms at home, and when you
walk  into one of the rooms, you detect this strange smell.  Can anyone tell
you  what that strange smell is?<br>
    <br>
    Now, all of us could do some wonderful guessing as to the smell and even
  what's causing it.  You would be absolutely amazed at the range and variety
  of smells we could come up with.  Even more amazing is that all of the
explanations   for the smells would be completely plausible."<br>

  <h3>  A growing number of MTAs serving list subscribers are rejecting all
HTML traffic. At least one MTA has gone so far as to blacklist shorewall.net
"for continuous abuse" because it has been my policy to allow HTML in list
posts!!<br>
  <br>
   I think that blocking all HTML is a Draconian way to control spam  and
that the ultimate losers here are not the spammers but the list subscribers
 whose MTAs are bouncing all shorewall.net mail. As one list subscriber wrote
to me privately "These e-mail admin's need to get a <i>(explitive deleted)</i> 
life instead of trying to rid the planet of HTML based e-mail". Nevertheless, 
to allow subscribers to receive list posts as must as possible, I have now
 configured the list server at shorewall.net to strip all HTML from outgoing 
posts.<br>
