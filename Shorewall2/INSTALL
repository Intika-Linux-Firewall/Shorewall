If your system supports rpm, I recommend that you install the Shorewall
.rpm. If you want to install from the tarball:

o Unpack the tarball
o cd to the shorewall-<version> directory
o If you have an earlier version of Shoreline Firewall installed,see the
  upgrade instructions below
o Edit the configuration files to fit your environment.

  To do this, I strongly advise you to follow the instructions at:

      http://www.shorewall.net/shorewall_quickstart_guide.htm

o If you are using Caldera, Redhat, Mandrake, Corel, Slackware, SuSE or
  Debian, then type "./install.sh".
o For other distributions, determine where your distribution installs
  init scripts and type "./install.sh <init script directory>"
o Start the firewall by typing "shorewall start"
o If the install script was unable to configure Shoreline Firewall to
  start automatically at boot, see the HTML documentation contains in the
  "documentation" directory.

Upgrade:

o run the install script as described above.
o shorewall restart
