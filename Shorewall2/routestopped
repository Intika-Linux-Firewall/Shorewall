# Shorewall 2.4 -- Hosts Accessible when the Firewall is Stopped
#
# /etc/shorewall/routestopped
#
#	This file is used to define the hosts that are accessible when the
#	firewall is stopped or when it is in the process of being
#	[re]started.
#
# Columns must be separated by white space and are:
#
#	INTERFACE	- Interface through which host(s) communicate with
#			  the firewall
#	HOST(S)		- (Optional) Comma-separated list of IP/subnet
#			  addresses. If your kernel and iptables include
#			  iprange match support, IP address ranges are also
#			  allowed.
#
#			  If left empty or supplied as "-",
#			  0.0.0.0/0 is assumed.
#	OPTIONS         - (Optional) A comma-separated list of
#			  options. The currently-supported options are:
#
#			  routeback - Set up a rule to ACCEPT traffic from
#			  these hosts back to themselves.
#
#			  loose - Allow traffic from these hosts to ANY
#			  destination. Without this option, only traffic
#			  from this host to other listed hosts (and the
#			  firewall) is allowed. If 'loose' is specified
#			  then 'routeback' is redundent.
#
# Example:
#
#	INTERFACE	HOST(S)			OPTIONS
#	eth2		192.168.1.0/24
#	eth0		192.0.2.44
#	br0		-			routeback
#	eth3		-			loose
#
# See http://shorewall.net/Documentation.htm#Routestopped and
# http://shorewall.net/starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm for additional 
# information.
