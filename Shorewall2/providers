#	This file is used to define additional routing tables. You will 
#	want to define an additional table if:
#
#	- You have connections to more than one ISP or multiple connections
#	  to the same ISP
#
#	- You run Squid as a transparent proxy on a host other than the 
#	  firewall.
#
#	To omit a column, enter "-".
#
# Columns must be separated by white space and are:
#
#	NAME		The provider name.
#
#	NUMBER		The provider number -- a number between 1 and 15
#
#	MARK		A FWMARK value used in your /etc/shorewall/tcrules
#			file to direct packets to this provider.
#
#	DUPLICATE	The name of an existing table to duplicate. May be
#			'main' or the name of a previous provider.
#
#	INTERFACE	The name of the network interface to the provider.
#			Must be listed in /etc/shorewall/interfaces.
#
#	GATEWAY		The IP address of the provider's gateway router.
#
#	OPTIONS		A comma-separated list selected from the following:
#
#		track	If specified, connections FROM this interface are
#			to be tracked so that responses may be routed back
#			out this same interface.
#
#			You want specify 'track' if internet hosts will be
#			connecting to local servers through this provider.
#
#		balance The providers that have 'default' specified will
#			get outbound traffic load-balanced among them.
#
# Example:  You run squid in your DMZ on IP address 192.168.2.99. Your DMZ
#	    interface is eth2
#
