New Features in version 2.3.0

1) Shorewall 2.3.0 supports the 'cmd-owner' option of the owner match
   facility in Netfilter. Like all owner match options, 'cmd-owner' may
   only be applied to traffic that originates on the firewall.

   The syntax of the USER/GROUP column in the following files has been
   extended:

	/etc/shorewall/accounting
	/etc/shorewall/rules
	/etc/shorewall/tcrules
	/usr/share/shorewall/action.template

   To specify a command, prefix the command name with "+".

   Examples:

	+mozilla-bin		#The program is named "mozilla-bin"
	joe+mozilla-bin		#The program is named "mozilla-bin" and
				#is being run by user "joe"
	joe:users+mozilla-bin	#The program is named "mozilla-bin" and
				#is being run by user "joe" with 
				#effective group "users".

   Note that this is not a particularly robust feature and I would
   never advertise it as a "Personal Firewall" equivalent. Using
   symbolic links, it's easy to alias command names to be anything you
   want.

2) Support has been added for ipsets
   (see http://people.netfilter.org/kadlec/ipset/).

   In most places where an host or network address may be used, you may
   also use the name of an ipset prefaced by "+". The name of the set
   may optionally followed by a number from 1 to 6 enclosed in square
   brackets ([]) -- this number indicates the maximum number of ipset
   binding levels that are to be matched. Depending on the context
   where the ipset name is used, either all "src" or all "dst" matches
   will be used.
 
   Example 1: Blacklist all hosts in an ipset named "blacklist"

	   /etc/shorewall/blacklist

	   #ADDRESS/SUBNET         PROTOCOL        PORT
	   +blacklist

   Example 2: Allow SSH from all hosts in an ipset named "sshok:

	   /etc/shorewall/rules

	   #ACTION      SOURCE      DEST     PROTO    DEST PORT(S)
           ACCEPT	+sshok      fw	     tcp      22
