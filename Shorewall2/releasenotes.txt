Shorewall 2.0.1-Beta2

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems Corrected since 2.0.0

1) Using actions in the manner recommended in the documentation
   results in a Warning that the rule is a policy.

Problems Corrected since 2.0.1 Beta 1

1) The BOGON_LOG_LEVEL variable is now included in shorewall.conf. It
   was inadvertently omitted from the Beta 1 file.

2) Previously, setting 'norfc1918' also set 'nobogons'; setting
   'nobogons' by itself had no effect.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues when migrating from Shorewall 2.0.0 to Shorewall 2.0.1:

1) The function of 'norfc1918' is now split between that option and a
   new 'nobogons' option.

   The rfc1918 file released with Shorewall now contains entries for
   only those three address ranges reserved by RFC 1918. A 'nobogons'
   interface option has been added which handles bogon source
   addresses (those which are reserved by the IANA, those reserved for
   DHCP auto-configuration and the class C test-net reserved for
   testing and documentation examples). This will allow users to
   perform RFC 1918 filtering without having to deal with out
   of date data from IANA. Those who are willing to update their
   /usr/share/shorewall/bogons file regularly can specify the
   'nobogons' option in addition to 'norfc1918'.

   The level at which bogon packets are logged is specified in the new
   BOGON_LOG_LEVEL variable in shorewall.conf. If that option is not
   specified or is specified as empty (e.g, BOGON_LOG_LEVEL="") then
   bogon packets whose TARGET is 'logdrop' in
   /usr/share/shorewall/bogons are logged at the 'info' level.

New Features:

1) Support for Bridging Firewalls has been added. For details, see

   http://shorewall.net/bridge.html

2) Support for NETMAP has been added. NETMAP allows NAT to be defined
   between two network:

	   a.b.c.1    -> x.y.z.1
	   a.b.c.2    -> x.y.z.2
	   a.b.c.3    -> x.y.z.3
	   ...
