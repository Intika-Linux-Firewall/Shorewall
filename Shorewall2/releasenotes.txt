New Features in version 2.3.0

1) Shorewall 2.3.0 supports the 'cmd-owner' option of the owner match
   facility in Netfilter. Like all owner match options, 'cmd-owner' may
   only be applied to traffic that originates on the firewall.

   The syntax of the USER/GROUP column in the following files has been
   extended:

	/etc/shorewall/accounting
	/etc/shorewall/rules
	/etc/shorewall/tcrules
	/usr/share/shorewall/action.template

   To specify a command, prefix the command name with "/".

   Examples:

	/mozilla-bin		#The program is named "mozilla-bin"
	joe/mozilla-bin		#The program is named "mozilla-bin" and
				#is being run by user "joe"
	joe:users/mozilla-bin	#The program is named "mozilla-bin" and
				#is being run by user "joe" with 
				#effective group "users".

   Note that this is not a particularly robust feature and I would
   never advertise it as a "Personal Firewall" equivalent. Using
   symbolic links, it's easy to alias command names to be anything you
   want.
