Shorewall 2.1.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems Corrected since 2.0.3

1)  A non-empty DEST entry in /etc/shorewall/tcrules will generate an
    error and Shorewall fails to start.

2)  A potential security vulnerablilty in the way that Shorewall
    handles temporary files and directories has been corrected.

3)  Two problems with logging NAT rules (DNAT and REDIRECT) could cause
    startup failures.

4)  Some users have reported the pkttype match option in iptables/
    Netfilter failing to match certain broadcast packets. The result 
    is that the firewall log shows a lot of broadcast packets.

    Users experiencing this problem can use PKTTYPE=No in
    shorewall.conf to cause Shorewall to use IP address filtering of 
    broadcasts rather than packet type.

Problems Corrected since 2.1.0

1)  The "check" command fails with the following message:

	iptables: No chain/target/match by that name

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues when migrating from Shorewall 2.0 to Shorewall 2.1:

1)  Shorewall configuration files except shorewall.conf are now empty
    (they contain only comments). If you wish to retain the defaults
    in any of the following files, you should copy these files before
    upgrading them then restore them after the upgrade:

    /etc/shorewall/zones
    /etc/shorewall/policy
    /etc/shorewall/tos

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:

1)  ICMP packets that are in the INVALID state are now dropped by the
    Reject and Drop default actions. They do so using the new 
    'dropInvalid' builtin action.

2)  The /etc/shorewall/masq file INTERFACE column now allows additional
    options.

    Normally MASQUERADE/SNAT rules are evaluated after one-to-one NAT 
    rules defined in the /etc/shorewall/nat file. If you preceed the
    interface name with a plus sign ("+") then the rule will be
    evaluated before one-to-one NAT.

    Examples:

	+eth0
	+eth1:192.0.2.32/27

    Also, the effect of ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes can be negated for an
    entry by following the interface name by ":" but no digit. 

    Examples:

	eth0:
	eth1::192.0.2.32/27
	+eth3:

3)  Similar to 2), the /etc/shorewall/nat file INTERFACE column now allows
    you to override the setting of ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes by following the
    interface name with ":" but no digit.

4)  All configuration files in the Shorewall distribution with the
    exception of shorewall.conf are now empty. In particular, the
    /etc/shorewall/zones, /etc/shorewall/policy and /etc/shorewall/tos
    files now have no active entries. Hopefully this will stop the
    questions on the support and development lists regarding why the
    default entries are the way they are.

5)  Previously, specifying a log level (and optionally a log tag) on a
    rule that specified a user-defined (or Shorewall-defined) action
    would log all traffic passed to the action. Beginning with this
    release, specifying a log level in a rule that specifies a user-
    or Shorewall-defined action will cause each rule in the action to
    be logged with the specified level (and tag).

    The extent to which logging of action rules occurs is goverend by
    the following:

    a) When you invoke an action and specify a log level, only those
    rules in the action that have no log level will be changed to log
    at the level specified at the action invocation.

    Example:

	/etc/shorewall/action.foo:

		ACCEPT	-	-	tcp	22
		bar:info	

	/etc/shorewall/rules:

		foo:debug	fw	net

	Logging in the invoke 'foo' action will be:

		ACCEPT:debug	-	-	tcp	22
		bar:info	

    b) If you follow the log level with "!" then logging will
    be at that level for all rules recursively invoked by the action

    Example:

	/etc/shorewall/action.foo:

		ACCEPT	-	-	tcp	22
		bar:info	

	/etc/shorewall/rules:

		foo:debug!	fw	net

	Logging in the invoke 'foo' action will be:

		ACCEPT:debug	-	-	tcp	22
		bar:debug!
