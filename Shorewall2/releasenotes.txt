Shorewall 2.1.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems Corrected since 2.0.3

1)  A non-empty DEST entry in /etc/shorewall/tcrules will generate an
    error and Shorewall fails to start.

2)  A potential security vulnerablilty in the way that Shorewall
    handles temporary files and directories has been corrected.

3)  Two problems with logging NAT rules (DNAT and REDIRECT) could cause
    startup failures.

4)  Some users have reported the pkttype match option in iptables/
    Netfilter failing to match certain broadcast packets. The result 
    is that the firewall log shows a lot of broadcast packets.

    Users experiencing this problem can use PKTTYPE=No in
    shorewall.conf to cause Shorewall to use IP address filtering of 
    broadcasts rather than packet type.

Problems Corrected since 2.1.0

1)  The "check" command fails with the following message:

	iptables: No chain/target/match by that name

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues when migrating from Shorewall 2.0 to Shorewall 2.1:

None.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:

1)  ICMP packets that are in the INVALID state are now dropped by the
    Reject and Drop default actions. They do so using the new 
    'dropInvalid' builtin action.

2)  The /etc/shorewall/masq file INTERFACE column now allows additional
    options.

    Normally MASQUERADE/SNAT rules are evaluated after one-to-one NAT 
    rules defined in the /etc/shorewall/nat file. If you preceed the
    interface name with a plus sign ("+") then the rule will be
    evaluated before one-to-one NAT.

    Examples:

	+eth0
	+eth1:192.0.2.32/27

    Also, the effect of ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes can be negated for an
    entry by following the interface name by ":" but no digit. 

    Examples:

	eth0:
	eth1::192.0.2.32/27
	+eth3:
