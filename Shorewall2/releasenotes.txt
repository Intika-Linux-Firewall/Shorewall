Shorewall 2.0.2-Beta 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems Corrected since 2.0.1

None.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues when migrating from Shorewall 2.0.0 to Shorewall 2.0.1:

1) Dynamic Zone support.

If you don't need to use the "shorewall add" and "shorewall delete"
commands, you should set DYNAMIC_ZONES=No in
/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf .

New Features:

1) The previous implementation of dynamic zones was difficult to
   maintain. I have changed the code to make dynamic zones optional
   under the control of the DYNAMIC_ZONES option in
   /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf.

2) In earlier Shorewall 2.0 releases, Shorewall searches in order the
   following directories for configuration files.

   a) The directory specified in a 'try' command or specified using
      the -c option.

   b) /etc/shorewall

   c) /usr/share/shorewall

   In this release, the CONFIG_PATH option is added to shorewall.conf.
   CONFIG_PATH contains a list of directory names separated by colons
   (":"). If not set or set to a null value (e.g., CONFIG_PATH="") then
   "CONFIG_PATH=/etc/shorewall:/usr/share/shorewall" is assumed.

   Now Shorewall searches for shorewall.conf according to the old
   rules and for other configuration files as follows:

   a) The directory specified in a 'try' command or specified using
      the -c option.

   b) Each directory in $CONFIG_PATH is searched in sequence.

   For those of you who are logic-challenged, your CONFIG_PATH should
   include both /etc/shorewall and /usr/share/shorewall (in that
   order, although there may be intervening directories).
