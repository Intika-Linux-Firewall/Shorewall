Shorewall 2.0.3 Beta 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems Corrected since 2.0.2

1) The 'firewall' script is not purging temporary restore files in
   /var/lib/shorewall. These files have names of the form
   "restore-nnnnn".

2) The /var/lib/shorewall/restore script did not load the kernel
   modules specified in /etc/shorewall/modules.

3) Specifying a null common action in /etc/shorewall/actions (e.g.,
   :REJECT) results in a startup error.

4) If /var/lib/shorewall does not exist, shorewall start fails.

5) DNAT rules with a dynamic source zone don't work properly. When
   used, these rules cause the rule to be checked against ALL input,
   not just input from the designated zone.

6) The install.sh script reported installing some files in
   /etc/shorewall when the files were actually installed in
   /usr/share/shorewall.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues when migrating from Shorewall 2.0.2 to Shorewall 2.0.3:

None.

New Features:

1) "!" is now allowed in accounting rules.

2) Interface names appearing within the configuration are now
   verified. Interface names must match the name of an entry in
   /etc/shorewall/interfaces (or if bridging is enabled, they must
   match the name of an entry in /etc/shorewall/interfaces or the name
   of a bridge port appearing in /etc/shorewall/hosts).
