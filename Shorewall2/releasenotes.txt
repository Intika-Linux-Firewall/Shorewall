This is a major release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected since version 1.4.9:

None.

Migration Issues/Incompatible Changes in this Release:

1) The 'dropunclean' and 'logunclean' interface options are no longer
   supported. If either option is specified in
   /etc/shorewall/interfaces, an error message will be generated and
   Shorewall will fail to start.

2) The NAT_BEFORE_RULES option has been removed from
   shorewall.conf. The behavior of Shorewall is as if
   NAT_BEFORE_RULES=No had been specified. In other words, DNAT rules
   now always take precidence over one-to-one NAT specifications.

3) The HAVEROUTE column has been removed from
   /etc/shorewall/proxyarp. Shorewall will no longer automatically add
   routes for Proxy ARP hosts. Use your distribution's static route
   capability to add these routes instead.

4) The default value for the ALL INTERFACES column in
   /etc/shorewall/nat has changed. In Shorewall 1.*, if the column was
   left empty, a value of "Yes" was assumed. This has been changed so
   that a value of "No" is now assumed.

New Features:

None.
