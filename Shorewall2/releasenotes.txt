Shorewall 2.0.1

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems Corrected since 2.0.0

1) Using actions in the manner recommended in the documentation
   results in a Warning that the rule is a policy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues when migrating from Shorewall 2.0.0 to Shorewall 2.0.1:

None.

New Features:

1) Support for Bridging Firewalls has been added. For details, see

   http://shorewall.net/bridge.html

2) The rfc1918 file released with Shorewall now contains entries for
   only those three address ranges reserved by RFC 1918. A new
   'nobogons' interface option has been added which handles bogon
   source addresses (those which are reserved by the IANA, those
   reserved for DHCP auto-configuration and the class C test-net
   reserved for testing and documentation examples). This will allow
   users to perform RFC 1918 filtering without having to deal with out
   of date data from IANA. Those who are willing to update their
   /usr/share/shorewall/bogons file regularly can specify the
   'nobogons' option in addition to 'norfc1918'.
