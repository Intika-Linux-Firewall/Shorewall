# Shorewall version 2.4 - Routing Rules
#
# /etc/shorewall/routes
#
#	Entries in this file cause packets to be routed in non-standard 
#       ways.
#
#                              I M P O R T A N T ! ! ! !
#
#	In order to use entries in this file, your kernel and iptables must
#	have ROUTE target support.
#
# Columns are:
#
#
#	SOURCE 		Source of the packet. May be any of the following:
#
#			- A host or network address
#			- A network interface name.
#			- The name of an ipset prefaced with "+"
#			- $FW (for packets originating on the firewall)
#			- A MAC address in Shorewall format
#			- A range of IP addresses (assuming that your
#			  kernel and iptables support range match)
#			- A network interface name followed by ":"
#			  and an address or address range.
#
#	DEST		Destination of the packet. May be any of the
#			following:
#
#			- A host or network address
#			- A network interface name (determined from
#			  routing table(s))
#			- The name of an ipset prefaced with "+"
#			- A network interface name followed by ":"
#			  and an address or address range. 
#
#	PROTO		Protocol - Must be "tcp", "udp", "icmp", "ipp2p", 
#			a number, or "all". "ipp2p" requires ipp2p match
#			support in your kernel and iptables.
#
#	PORT(S)		Destination Ports. A comma-separated list of Port
#			names (from /etc/services), port numbers or port
#			ranges; if the protocol is "icmp", this column is
#			interpreted as the destination icmp-type(s).
#
#			If the protocol is ipp2p, this column is interpreted
#			as an ipp2p option without the leading "--" (example "bit"
#			for bit-torrent). If no PORT is given, "ipp2p" is
#			assumed.
#
#			This column is ignored if PROTOCOL = all but must be
#			entered if any of the following field is supplied.
#			In that case, it is suggested that this field contain
#			 "-"
#
#	SOURCE PORT(S)	(Optional) Source port(s). If omitted,
#			any source port is acceptable. Specified as a comma-
#			separated list of port names, port numbers or port
#			ranges.
#
#	INTERFACE	The interface that the packet is to be routed out of.
#
#	GATEWAY		The gateway that the packet is to be forewarded through.
#
# See http://shorewall.net/Shorewall_and_Routing.html for additional information.
