# Shorewall 2.4 /etc/shorewall/actions
#
#	This file allows you to define new ACTIONS for use in rules 
#	(/etc/shorewall/rules). You define the iptables rules to
#	be performed in an ACTION in
#	/etc/shorewall/action.<action-name>.
#
#	ACTION names should begin with an upper-case letter to
#	distinguish them from Shorewall-generated chain names and
#	they must meet the requirements of a Netfilter chain. If
#	you intend to log from the action then the name must be
#	no longer than 11 character in length. Names must also
#	meet the requirements for a Bourne Shell identifier (must
#	begin with a letter and be composed of letters, digits and
#	underscore characters).
#
#	If you follow the action name with ":DROP", ":REJECT" or
#	:ACCEPT then the action will be taken before a DROP, REJECT or
#	ACCEPT policy respectively is enforced. If you specify ":DROP",
#	":REJECT" or ":ACCEPT" on more than one action then only the
#	last such action will be taken.
#
#	If you specify ":DROP", ":REJECT" or ":ACCEPT" on a line by
#	itself, the associated policy will have no common action.
#
#	Please see http://shorewall.net/Actions.html for additional
#	information.
