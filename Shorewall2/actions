# Shorewall 2.0 /etc/shorewall/actions
#
#	This file allows you to define new ACTIONS for use in rules 
#	(/etc/shorewall/rules). You define the iptables rules to
#	be performed in an ACTION in
#	/etc/shorewall/action.<action-name>.
#
#	ACTION names should begin with an upper-case letter to
#	distinguish them from Shorewall-generated chain names and
#	they must need the requirements of a Netfilter chain
#	name.
#
#	If you follow the action name with ":DROP" or ":REJECT" then
#       the action will be taken before a DROP or REJECT policy
#       respectively is enforced. If you specify ":DROP" or ":REJECT"
#	on more than one action then only the last such action will be
#	taken.
