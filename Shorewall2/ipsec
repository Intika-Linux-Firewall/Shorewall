# Shorewall 2.4 - /etc/shorewall/ipsec
#
#	This file defines the attributes of zones with respect to
#	IPSEC. To use this file, you must be running a 2.6 kernel and
#       both your kernel and iptables must include Policy Match Support.
#
#	The columns are:
#
#		ZONE	The name of a zone defined in /etc/shorewall/zones. The
#			$FW zone may not be listed.
#
#		IPSEC   Yes --  Communication with all zone hosts is encrypted
#		ONLY	No  --  Communication with some zone hosts is encrypted. 
#				Encrypted hosts are designated using the 'ipsec'
#				option in /etc/shorewall/hosts. 				
#
#		OPTIONS,        A comma-separated list of options as follows:
#		IN OPTIONS,
#		OUT OPTIONS	reqid=<number> where <number> is specified
#				using setkey(8) using the 'unique:<number>
#				option for the SPD level.
#
#				spi=<number> where <number> is the SPI of
#				the SA used to encrypt/decrypt packets.
#
#				proto=ah|esp|ipcomp
#
#				mss=<number> (sets the MSS field in TCP packets) 
#
#				mode=transport|tunnel
#
#				tunnel-src=<address>[/<mask>] (only
#				available with mode=tunnel)
#
#				tunnel-dst=<address>[/<mask>] (only
#				available with mode=tunnel)
#
#				strict  Means that packets must match all rules.
#
#				next    Separates rules; can only be used with
#                                       strict..
#
#			Example:
#				mode=transport,reqid=44
#
#		The options in the OPTIONS column are applied to both incoming
#		and outgoing traffic. The IN OPTIONS are applied to incoming
#		traffic (in addition to OPTIONS) and the OUT OPTIONS are 
#		applied to outgoing traffic.
#
#		If you wish to leave a column empty but need to make an entry
#		in a following column, use "-".
