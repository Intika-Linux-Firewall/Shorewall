# Shorewall version 3.2 - IPPserver Macro
#
# /usr/share/shorewall/macro.IPPserver
#
#	This macro handles Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), indicating
#	that DEST is a printing server for SOURCE.  The macro allows
#	print queue broadcasts from the server to the client, and
#	printing connections from the client to the server.
#
#	Example usage on a single-interface firewall which is a print
#	client:
#		IPPserver/ACCEPT $FW lan
#
#	Example for a two-interface firewall which acts as a print
#	server for loc:
#		IPPserver/ACCEPT loc $FW
