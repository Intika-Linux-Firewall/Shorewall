----------------------------------------------------------------------------
               R E L E A S E  4 . 3  H I G H L I G H T S
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Support is included for IPv6.

Problems Corrected in 4.3.1

1) Shorewall6 parsing of the hosts file HOSTS column has been
   corrected.

Other changes in 4.3.1

1) It is now permitted to enclose addresses in [] even when an
   interface name is not specified.

   Example:

	ACCEPT	net:[2001:1::1]	$FW

2) The Socket6 perl module is only required now if DNS names appear in
   your Shorewall6 configuration files.

3) Shorewall6 now recognizes IPv4 addresses embedded in the IPv6
   address space (e.g., ::ffff:192.168.1.3).

Migration Issues.

   None.

New Features in Shorewall 4.3

1) Two new packages are included:

   a) Shorewall6 - analagous to Shorewall-common but handles IPv6
      rather than IPv4.

   b) Shorewall6-lite - analagous to Shorewall-lite but handles IPv6
      rather than IPv4.

   The packages store their configurations in /etc/shorewall6/ and
   /etc/shorewall6-lite/ respectively.  

   The fact that the packages are separate from their IPv4 counterparts
   means that you control IPv4 and IPv6 traffic separately (the same
   way that Netfilter does). Starting/Stopping the firewall for one
   address family has no effect on the other address family.

   Other features of Shorewall6 are:

   a) There is no NAT of any kind (most people see this as a giant step
      forward). When an ISP assigns you a public IPv6 address, you are
      actually assigned an IPv6 'prefix' which is like an IPv4
      subnet. A 96-bit prefix allows 4 billion individual hosts (the
      size of the current IPv4 address space).

   b) The default zone type is ipv6.

   c) The currently-supported interface options in Shorewall6 are:

	blacklist
        bridge
	optional
	routeback
	sourceroute
        tcpflags
	mss
	forward (replaces the IP_FORWARDING .conf option -- forwarding
                 is enabled on a per-interface basis in IPv6).

   d)  The currently-supported host options in Shorewall6 are:

	blacklist
	routeback
	tcpflags

   e)  Traffic Shaping and Multi-ISP support are currently disabled. Packet
       marking and connection marking are available to feed your current
       traffic shaping defined in Shorewall.

   f)  When both an interface and an address or address list need to
       be specified in a rule, the address or list must be enclosed in
       square brackets. Example:

	ACCEPT	net:eth0:[2001:19f0:feee::dead:beef:cafe]	dmz

       Note that this includes MAC addresses as well as IPv6 addresses.

       The HOSTS column in /etc/shorewall6/hosts also uses this
       convention:

       #ZONE      HOSTS					OPTIONS
       chat6	  eth0:[2001:19f0:feee::dead:beef:cafe]

   g)  There are currently no Shorewall6 or Shorewall6-lite manpages.

   h)  The options available in shorewall6.conf are a subset of those
       available in shorewall.conf.

   i)  The Socket6.pm Perl module is required if you include DNS names
       in your Shorewall6 configuration. Note that it is loaded the
       first time that a DNS name is encountered so if it is missing,
       you get a message similar to this one:

       ...
       Checking /etc/shorewall6/rules...
       Can't locate Socket6.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /root ...
       teastep@ursa:~/Configs/standalone6$
