New Features in Shorewall 4.3

1) Two new packages are included:

   a) Shorewall6 - analagous to Shorewall-common but handles IPv6
      rather than IPv4.

   b) Shorewall6-lite - analagous to Shorewall-lite but handles IPv6
      rather than IPv4.

   The packages store their configurations in /etc/shorewall6/ and
   /etc/shorewall6-lite/ respectively.  

   The fact that the packages are separate from their IPv4 counterparts
   means that you control IPv4 and IPv6 traffic separately (the same
   way that Netfilter does). Starting/Stopping the firewall for one
   address family has no effect on the other address family.

   Other features of Shorewall6 are:

   a) There is no NAT of any kind (most people see this as a giant step
      forward). When an ISP assigns you a public IPv6 address, you are
      actually assigned an IPv6 'prefix' which is like an IPv4
      subnet. A 96-bit prefix allows 4 billion individual hosts (the
      size of the current IPv4 address space).

   b) The default zone type is ipv6.

   c) The currently-supported interface options in Shorewall6 are:

	blacklist
        bridge
	optional
	routeback
	sourceroute
        tcpflags
	mss
	forward (replaces the IP_FORWARDING .conf option -- forwarding
                 is enabled on a per-interface basis in IPv6).

   d)  The currently-supported host options in Shorewall6 are:

	blacklist
	routeback
	tcpflags

   e)  Traffic Shaping and Multi-ISP support are currently disabled. Packet
       marking and connection marking are available to feed your current
       traffic shaping defined in Shorewall.

   f)  When both an interface and an IPv6 address or address list need to
       be specified in a rule, the address or list must be enclosed in
       square brackets. Example:

	ACCEPT	net:eth0:[2001:19f0:feee::dead:beef:cafe]	dmz

   g)  There are currently no Shorewall6 or Shorewall6-lite manpages.

   h)  The options available in shorewall6.conf are a subset of those
       available in shorewall.conf.
