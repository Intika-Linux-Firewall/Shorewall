Shorewall 3.9.1

Release Highlights

1) This is the first Shorewall release that fully integrates the new
   Shorewall-perl compiler.

2) You are now offered a choice as to which compiler(s) you install. In
   3.9.1, there are the following packages:

   - Shorewall ( common files )
   - Shorewall-shell ( the shell-based compiler )
   - Shorewall-perl (the Perl-based compiler )

You must install Shorewall and at least one of the compiler packages
(you may install them both).

Problems corrected in Shorewall 3.9.1

Migration Considerations:

1)  You cannot simply upgrade your existing Shorewall package. You must
    upgrade Shorewall *and* install one or both of the compilers.

    If you attempt to upgrade using the RPM, you get this result:

    gateway:~ # rpm -Uvh shorewall-3.9.1-1.noarch.rpm 
    error: Failed dependencies:
        shorewall_compiler is needed by shorewall-3.9.1-1.noarch
    gateway:~ #

    You must either:

	rpm -U shorewall-3.9.1.noarch.rpm shorewall-shell-3.9.1.noarch.rpm

    or

	rpm -U shorewall-3.9.1.noarch.rpm shorewall-perl-3.9.1.noarch.rpm
	
    or
	rpm -i shorewall-shell-3.9.1.noarch.rpm
	rpm -U shorewall-3.9.1.noarch.rpm

    or
	rpm -i shorewall-perl-3.9.1.noarch.rpm
	rpm -U shorewall-3.9.1.noarch.rpm

    If you are upgrading using the tarball, you must install either
    shorewall-shell or shorewall-perl before you upgrade
    Shorewall. Otherwise, the install.sh script fails with:

         ERROR: No Shorewall compiler is installed

    The shorewall-shell and shorewall-perl packages are installed from
    the tarball in the expected way; untar the package, and run the
    install.sh script.
