Shorewall 4.0 Patch release 4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
               R E L E A S E  4 . 0  H I G H L I G H T S
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) This is the first Shorewall release that fully integrates the new
   Shorewall-perl compiler. See the "New Features" section below.

2) You are now offered a choice as to which compiler(s) you install. In
   4.0.0, there are the following packages:

   - Shorewall-common ( common files )
   - Shorewall-shell ( the shell-based compiler )
   - Shorewall-perl (the Perl-based compiler )

   You must install at least one of the compiler packages (you may
   install them both) along with Shorewall-common.

   YOU DO NOT NEED TO UNINSTALL ANY OF YOUR CURRENT PACKAGES.

   See the Migration Considerations below for further information.

3) The facilities for supporting bridge/firewalls under earlier
   releases are deprecated and their documentation is omitted from the
   4.0 distribution. New bridge support is implemented in the
   Shorewall-perl compiler. This support utilizes the reduced-function
   physdev match support available in Linux kernel 2.6.20 and later.

Problems Corrected in Shorewall 4.0.4

1)  If no interface had the 'blacklist' option, then when using
    Shorewall-perl, the 'start' and 'restart' command fail:

        ERROR: No filter chain found with name blacklst

    New Shorewall-perl 4.0.3 packages were released that corrected this
    problem; it is included here for completeness.

2)  If no interface had the 'blacklist' option, then when using
    Shorewall-perl, the generated script would issue this harmless
    message during 'shorewall refresh':

        chainlist_reload: Not found

3)  If /bin/sh was a light-weight shell such as ash or dash, then
    'shorewall refresh' failed.

4)  During start/restart, the script generated by Shorewall-perl is
    clearing the proxy_arp flag on all interfaces; that is not the
    documented behavior.

5)  If the module-init-tools package was not installed and
    /etc/shorewall/modules did not exist or was non-empty, then
    Shorewall-perl would fail with the message:

       ERROR: Can't run lsmod : /etc/shorewall/modules (line 0)

6)  Shorewall-perl now makes a compile-time check to insure that
    iptables-restore exists and is executable. This check is made when
    the compiler is being run by root and the -e option is not
    given.

    Note that iptables-restore must reside in the same directory as the
    iptables executable specified by IPTABLES in shorewall.conf or
    located by the PATH in the event that IPTABLES is not specified.

Other Changes in Shorewall 4.0.4

None.

Migration Considerations:

1)  Beginning with Shorewall 4.0.0, there is no single 'shorewall'
    package. Rather there are two compiler packages (shorewall-shell
    and shorewall-perl) and a set of base files (shorewall-common)
    which are required by either compiler package.

    Although the names of the packages are changing, you can upgrade
    without having to uninstall/reinstall.

    To repeat: YOU DO NOT NEED TO UNINSTALL ANY EXISTING PACKAGE.

    If you attempt to upgrade using the shorewall-common RPM, you get
    this result:

    gateway:~ # rpm -Uvh shorewall-common-4.0.0.noarch.rpm 
    error: Failed dependencies:
        shorewall_compiler is needed by shorewall-common-4.0.0-1.noarch
    gateway:~ #

    You must either:

	rpm -Uvh shorewall-shell-4.0.0.noarch.rpm \
	    shorewall-common-4.0.0.noarch.rpm

    or

	rpm -Uvh shorewall-shell-4.0.0.noarch.rpm \
	    shorewall-perl-4.0.0.noarch.rpm \
	    shorewall-common-4.0.0.noarch.rpm

    If you don't want to use shorewall-perl exclusively then use the
    second command above then

        rpm -e shorewall-shell
 
    If you are upgrading using the tarball, you must install 
    shorewall-shell and/or shorewall-perl before you upgrade
    using shorewall-common. Otherwise, the install.sh script fails with:

         ERROR: No Shorewall compiler is installed

    The shorewall-shell and shorewall-perl packages are installed from
    the tarball in the expected way; untar the package, and run the
    install.sh script.

    Example 1: You have 'shorewall' installed and you want to continue
    to use the shorewall-shell compiler.

	tar -jxf shorewall-common-4.0.0.tar.bz2
	tar -jxf shorewall-shell-4.0.0.tar.bz2

	cd shorewall-shell-4.0.0
	./install.sh
	cd ../shorewall-common-4.0.0
	./install.sh
	shorewall check
	shorewall restart

    Example 2: You have shorewall 3.4.4 and shorewall-perl 4.0.0-Beta7
    installed and you want to upgrade to 4.0. You do not need the
    shell-based compiler.

	tar -jxf shorewall-common-4.0.0.tar.bz2
	tar -jxf shorewall-perl-4.0.0.tar.bz2

	cd shorewall-perl-4.0.0
	./install.sh
	cd ../shorewall-common-4.0.0
	./install.sh
	shorewall check
	shorewall restart

        Be sure to modify shorewall.conf if it still has
        SHOREWALL_COMPILER=shell.

2)  The ROUTE_FILTER and LOG_MARTIANS options in shorewall.conf work
    slightly differently in Shorewall 4.0.0. In prior releases, leaving
    these options empty was equivalent to setting them to 'No' which
    caused the corresponding flag in /proc to be reset for all
    interfaces. Beginning in Shorewall 4.0.0, leaving these options
    empty causes Shorewall to leave the flags in /proc as they are. You
    must set the option to 'No' in order to obtain the old behavior.

3)  The -f option is no longer the default when Shorewall is started at
    boot time (usually via /etc/init.d/shorewall). With Shorewall-perl,
    "shorewall start" is nearly as fast as "shorewall restore" and
    "shorewall start" uses the current configuration which avoids
    confusion.

    If you plan on continuing to use Shorewall-shell and you want to
    use the "-f" option at boot time, then you must add the following
    to /etc/sysconfig/shorewall or /etc/default/shorewall:

       OPTIONS="-f"

    If you currently have neither of those files, you will need to
    create one of them. 

4)  This issue will only affect you if you use Shorewall Lite and have
    modified /usr/share/configpath to specify a different LITEDIR.

    The implementation of LITEDIR has always been
    unsatisfactory. Furthermore, there have been other cases where
    people have asked to be able to designate the state directory
    (default /var/lib/shorewall[-lite]).

    To meet these objectives:

    a)  The LITEDIR variable has been eliminated in
        /usr/share/shorewall[-lite]/configpath.

    b)  A new file /etc/shorewall[-lite]/vardir has been added. This
        file is not created by default but may be added as needed. It
        is expected to contain a single variable assignment:

	   VARDIR=<directory>

	Example:

	   VARDIR=/root/shorewall
    
    To change VARDIR, copy the old directory to the new one before you
    restart Shorewall[-lite].

    To use this feature with Shorewall-lite, all packages involved
    (compiler, shorewall-common and shorewall-lite) must be version
    4.0.0-RC2 or later.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         N E W  F E A T U R E S
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Shorewall-perl

    This Shorewall package includes a complete rewrite of the compiler
    in Perl.

    I decided to make Shorewall-perl a separate package for several reasons:

    a) Embedded applications are unlikely to adopt Shorewall-perl; even
       Mini-Perl has a substantial disk and RAM footprint.

    b) Because of the gross incompatibilities between the new compiler and the
       old (see below), migration to the new compiler must be voluntary.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      T H E   G O O D   N E W S:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    a) The compiler has a small disk footprint.
    b) The compiler is very fast.
    c) The compiler generates a firewall script that uses iptables-restore;
       so the script is very fast.
    d) The new compiler does a much better job of validating the
       configuration and catches many errors that resulted in run-time
       failures with the old compiler.
    e) Use of the Shorewall-perl is optional! The old slow clunky
       Bourne-shell compiler is still available.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      T H E   B A D   N E W S:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are a number of incompatibilities between the Perl-based compiler
    and the Bourne-shell one.

    a) The Perl-based compiler requires the following capability in your
       kernel and iptables.

       - multiport match

       This capability is in current distributions.

    b) Now that Netfilter has features to deal reasonably with port lists,
       I see no reason to duplicate those features in Shorewall. The
       Bourne-shell compiler goes to great pain (in some cases) to
       break very long port lists ( > 15 where port ranges in lists
       count as two ports) into individual rules. In the new compiler, I'm
       avoiding the ugliness required to do that. The new compiler just
       generates an error if your list is too long. It will also produce
       an error if you insert a port range into a port list and you don't
       have extended multiport support.

    c) The old BRIDGING=Yes support has been replaced by new bridge
       support that uses the reduced 'physdev match' capabilities found
       in kernel 2.6.20 and later. This new implementation may be used
       where it is desired to control traffic through a bridge.

       The new implementation includes the following features:

       a)  A new "Bridge Port" zone type is defined. Specify 'bport' or
	   'bport4' in the TYPE column of /etc/shorewall/zones.

	   Bridge Port zones should be a sub-zone of a regular ipv4 zone
	   that represents all hosts attached to the bridge.

       b)  A new 'bridge' option is defined for entries in	
	   /etc/shorewall/interfaces. Bridges should have this option
	   specified, even if you don't want to filter traffic going
	   through the bridge.

       c)  Bridge ports must now be defined in
	   /etc/shorewall/interfaces. The INTERFACE column contains
	   both the bridge name and the port name separated by a colon
	   (e.g., "br0:eth1"). No OPTIONS are allowed for bridge
	   ports. The bridge must be defined before its ports and must
	   have the 'bridge' option.

       Bridge Port (BP) zones have a number of limitations:

       a)  Each BP zone may only be associated with ports on a single
	   bridge.

       b)  BP zones may not be associated with interfaces that are not
	   bridge ports.

       c)  You may not have policies or rules where the DEST is a BP
	   zone but the source is not a BP zone. If you need such
	   rules, you must use the BP zone's parent zone as the DEST
	   zone.

       Example (Bridge br0 with ports eth1 and tap0):

       /etc/shorewall/zones:

	fw	firewall
	net	ipv4
	loc	ipv4
	lan:loc	bport
	vpn:loc bport

       /etc/shorewall/interfaces:

	net	eth0	-	...
	loc	br0	-	...
	lan	eth1
	vpn	tap0

       When using the /etc/shorewall/hosts file to define a bport4
       zone, you specify only the port name:

       Example:

       /etc/shorewall/zones:

	fw	firewall
	net	ipv4
	loc	ipv4
	lan:loc	bport
	vpn:loc bport

       /etc/shorewall/hosts

	lan	eth1:192.168.2.0/24	...

       The structure of the accounting rules changes slightly when
       there are bridges defined in the Shorewall
       configuration. Because of the restrictions imposed by Netfilter
       in kernel 2.6.21 and later, output accounting rules must be
       segregated from forwarding and input rules.

       To accomplish this separation, Shorewall-perl creates two
       accounting chains:

       - accounting - for input and forwarded traffic.
       - accountout - for output traffic.

       If the CHAIN column contains '-', then:

       - If the SOURCE column in a rule includes the name of the
         firewall zone (e.g., $FW), then the rule is add only
         to the accountout chain.

       - Otherwise, if the DEST in the rule is any or all or 0.0.0.0/0,
	 then the rule is added to both accounting and accountout.

       - Otherwise, the rule is added to accounting only.

       See http://www.shorewall.net/4.0/bridge-Shorewall-perl.html for
       additional information about the new bridge support.	

    d) The BROADCAST column in the interfaces file is essentially unused;
       if you enter anything in this column but '-' or 'detect', you will
       receive a warning.

    e) Because the compiler is written in Perl, some of your extension
       scripts from earlier versions will no longer work because
       Shorewall-perl runs those extension scripts at compile-time rather
       than at run-time. 

       Compile-time scripts are:

           initdone
	   maclog
	   All per-chain scripts including those associated with actions.

       Compile-time extension scripts are executed using the Perl 'eval
       `cat <file>`' mechanism. Be sure that each script returns a
       'true' value; otherwise, the compiler will assume that the
       script failed and will abort the compilation.

       All scripts will need to begin with the following line:

	   use Shorewall::Chains;

       For more complex scripts, you may need to 'use' other Shorewall
       Perl modules -- browse /usr/share/shorewall-perl/Shorewall/ to
       see what's available.

       When a script is invoked, the $chainref scalar variable will hold a
       reference to a chain table entry. 

           $chainref->{name}  contains the name of the chain
           $chainref->{table} holds the table name
       
           To add a rule to the chain:

	      add_rule( $chainref, <the rule> );

           Where

              <the rule> is a scalar argument holding the rule text. Do
              not include "-A <chain name>"

           Example:

              add_rule( $chainref, '-j ACCEPT' );

           To insert a rule into the chain:

              insert_rule( $chainref, <rulenum>, <the rule> );

           The log_rule_limit function works like it does in the shell
           compiler with two exceptions:

              - You pass the chain reference rather than the name of
                the chain.
	      - The commands are 'add' and 'insert' rather than '-A'
                and '-I'.
	      - There is only a single "pass as-is to iptables"
                argument (so you must quote that part).

           Example:

	      log_rule_limit(
	      	             'info' , 
			      $chainref ,	     
			      $chainref->{name},
			      'DROP' , 
			      '',      #Limit
			      '' ,     #Log tag
			      'add',   #Command
			      '-p tcp' #Pass as-is
                             );

       Note that in the 'initdone' script, there is no default chain
       ($chainref). You can objtain a reference to a standard chain by:

           my $chainref = $chain_table{<table>}{<chain name>};

       Example:

           my $chainref = $chain_table{'filter'}{'INPUT'};

       The continue script is eliminated. That script was designed to
       allow you to add special rules during [re]start. Shorewall-perl
       doesn't need such rules.

       See http://www.shorewall.net/4.0/shorewall_extension_scripts.htm
       for further information about extension scripts under
       Shorewall-perl.

    f) The 'refresh' command now works like 'restart' with the
       following exceptions:

       - The refresh command is rejected if Shorewall is not running.
       - The refresh command only rebuilds the 'blacklst' chain.
       - A directory name may not be specified in the refresh command.

    g) The /etc/shorewall/tos file now has zone-independent SOURCE and
       DEST columns as do all other files except the rules and policy
       files.

       The SOURCE column may be one of the following:

           [all:]<address>[,...]
           [all:]<interface>[:<address>[,...]]
           $FW[:<address>[,...]]

       The DEST column may be one of the following:
       
           [all:]<address>[,...]
           [all:]<interface>[:<address>[,...]]

       This is a permanent change. The old zone-based rules have never
       worked right and this is a good time to replace them. I've tried
       to make the new syntax cover the most common cases without
       requiring change to existing files. In particular, it will
       handle the tos file released with Shorewall 1.4 and earlier.

    h) Shorewall-perl insists that ipset names begin with a letter and 
       be composed of alphanumeric characters and underscores (_). When
       used in a Shorewall configuration file, the name must be
       preceded by a plus sign (+) as with the shell-based compiler.

       Shorewall-perl is now out of the ipset load/reload business. With
       scripts generated by the Perl-based Compiler, the Netfilter
       ruleset is never cleared. That means that there is no
       opportunity for Shorewall to load/reload your ipsets since that
       cannot be done while there are any current rules using ipsets.

       So:

	i)   Your ipsets must be loaded before Shorewall starts. You
	     are free to try to do that with the following code in
	     /etc/shorewall/start:

	     if [ "$COMMAND" = start ]; then
		ipset -U :all: :all:
		ipset -F
		ipset -X
		ipset -R < /my/ipset/contents
	     fi

	     The file '/my/ipset/contents' (not its real name of
	     course) will normally be produced using the ipset -S
	     command.

	     The above will work most of the time but will fail in a
	     'shorewall stop' - 'shorewall start' sequence if you
	     use ipsets in your routestopped file (see below).

	ii)  Your ipsets may not be reloaded until Shorewall is stopped
	     or cleared.

	iii) If you specify ipsets in your routestopped file then
	     Shorewall must be cleared in order to reload your ipsets.

       As a consequence, scripts generated by the Perl-based compiler
       will ignore /etc/shorewall/ipsets and will issue a warning if
       you set SAVE_IPSETS=Yes in shorewall.conf.

    i) Because the configuration files (with the exception of
       /etc/shorewall/params) are now processed by the Perl-based
       compiler rather than by the shell, only the basic forms of Shell
       expansion ($variable and ${variable}) are supported. The more
       exotic forms such as ${variable:=default} are not
       supported. Both variables defined in /etc/shorewall/params and
       environmental variables (exported by the shell) can be used in
       configuration files.

    j) USE_ACTIONS=No is not supported. That option is intended to
       minimize Shorewall's footprint in embedded applications. As a
       consequence, Default Macros are not supported.

    k) DELAYBLACKLISTLOAD=Yes is not supported. The entire ruleset is
       atomically loaded with one execution of iptables-restore.

    l) MAPOLDACTIONS=Yes is not supported. People should have converted
       to using macros by now.

    m) The pre Shorewall-3.0 format of the zones file is not supported;
       neither is the /etc/shorewall/ipsec file.

    n) BLACKLISTNEWONLY=No is not permitted with FASTACCEPT=Yes. This
       combination doesn't work in previous versions of Shorewall so
       the Perl-based compiler simply rejects it.

    o) Shorewall-perl has a single rule generator that is used for all
       rule-oriented files. So it is important that the syntax is
       consistent between files.
       
       With shorewall-shell, there is a special syntax in the SOURCE
       column of /etc/shorewall/masq to designate "all traffic entering
       the firewall on this interface except...".

       Example:

       #INTERFACE	SOURCE			ADDRESSES
       eth0		eth1!192.168.4.9	...

       Shorewall-perl uses syntax that is consistent with the rest of
       Shorewall:

       #INTERFACE	SOURCE			ADDRESSES
       eth0		eth1:!192.168.4.9	...

    p) The 'allowoutUPnP' built-in action is no longer supported. The
       Netfilter team have removed support for '-m owner --owner-cmd'
       which that action depended on. 

    q) The treatment of the following interface options has changed under
       Shorewall-perl.

       - arp_filter
       - routefilter
       - logmartians
       - proxy_arp
       - sourceroute

       With the Shorewall-shell compiler, Shorewall resets these options
       on all interfaces then sets the option on those interfaces
       for which the option is defined in /etc/shorewall/interfaces.

       Under Shorewall-perl, these options can be specified with the value
       0 or 1 (e.g., proxy_arp=0). If no value is specified, the value 1
       is assumed. Shorewall will modify only the setting of those
       interfaces for which the option is specified and will set the
       option to the given value.

       A fatal compilation error is also generated if you specify one of
       these options with a wildcard interface (one ending with '+').

    r) The LOG_MARTIANS and ROUTE_FILTER options are now tri-valued in
       Shorewall-perl.

	Yes -  Same as before
	No  -  Same as before except that it applies regardless of
	       whether any interfaces have the logmartians/routefilter
	       option
	Keep - Shorewall ignores the option entirely (which is the
	default).

    s)  Shorewall-perl support nn 'optional' option has been added to
        /etc/shorewall/interfaces. This option is recognized by
        Shorewall-perl but not by Shorewall-shell. When 'optional' is
        specified for an interface, Shorewall will be silent when:

        - a /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/ entry for the interface cannot be
          modified (including for proxy ARP).

        - The first address of the interface cannot be obtained.

        I specify 'optional' on interfaces to Xen virtual machines that
        may or may not be running when Shorewall is [re]started.

        CAUTION: Use 'optional' at your own risk. If you [re]start
        Shorewall when an 'optional' interface is not available and then
        do a 'shorewall save', subsequent 'shorewall restore' and
        'shorewall -f start' operations will instantiate a ruleset that
        does not support that interface, even if it is available at the
        time of the restore/start.

     t) Shorewall-perl validates all IP addresses and addresses ranges
        in rules. DNS names are resolved and an error is issued for any
	name that cannot be resolved.
     u) Shorewall-perl checks configuration files for the presense of
	characters that can cause problems if they are allowed into the
	generated firewall script:

	- Double Quotes. These are prohibited except in the
	  shorewall.conf and params files.

	- Single Quotes. These are prohibited except in the
	  shorewall.conf and params files and in COMMENT lines.

	- Single back quotes. These are prohibited except in the 
	  shorewall.conf and params files.

	- Backslash. Probibited except as the last character on a line
          to denote line continuation.

     v) Under Shorewall-perl, macros may invoke other macros with the
        restriction that such macros may not be invoked within an action
	body.

	When marcros are invoked recursively, the parameter passed to an
	invocation are automatically propagated to lower level macros.

	 Macro invocations may be nested to a maximum level of 5.

     w) The PKTTYPE option is ignored by Shorewall-perl. Shorewall-perl 
        will use Address type match if it is available; otherwise, it 
	will behave as if PKTTYPE=No had been specified.

     x) Shorewall-perl detects dead policy file entries that result
        when an entry is masked by an earlier more general
        entry. Example:

	 all	 all	  REJECT    info
	 loc	 net	  ACCEPT

    If you only install one compiler, then that compiler will be used.

    If you install both compilers, then the compiler actually used depends
    on the SHOREWALL_COMPILER setting in shorewall.conf.

    The value of this new option can be either 'perl' or 'shell'.

    If you add 'SHOREWALL_COMPILER=perl' to /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf
    then by default, the new compiler will be used on the system. If you
    add it to shorewall.conf in a separate directory (such as a
    Shorewall-lite export directory) then the new compiler will only be
    used when you compile from that directory.

    If you only install one compiler, it is suggested that you do not set
    SHOREWALL_COMPILER.

    You can also select the compiler to use on the command line using the
    'C option:

       '-C shell' means use the shell compiler
       '-C perl' means use the perl compiler

    The -C option overrides the setting in shorewall.conf. 

    Example:

	shorewall restart -C perl

2)  Thanks to Paul Gear, an IPPServer macro has been added. Be sure to
    read the comments in the macro file before trying to use this
    macro.

3)  Eariler generations of Shorewall Lite required that remote root
    login via ssh be enabled in order to use the 'load' and 'reload'
    commands.

    Beginning with this release, you may define an alternative means
    for accessing the remote firewall system.

    Two new options have been added to shorewall.conf:

	RSH_COMMAND
	RCP_COMMAND

    The default values for these are as follows:

	RSH_COMMAND: ssh ${root}@${system} ${command}
	RCP_COMMAND: scp ${files} ${root}@${system}:${destination}

    Shell variables that will be set when the commands are envoked are
    as follows:

       root  - root user. Normally 'root' but may be overridden using
               the '-r' option.

       system - The name/IP address of the remote firewall system.

       command - For RSH_COMMAND, the command to be executed on the 
                 firewall system.

       files   - For RCP_COMMAND, a space-separated list of files to
                 be copied to the remote firewall system.

       destination - The directory on the remote system that the files 
                     are to be copied into. 

4)  The accounting, masq, rules and tos files now have a 'MARK' column
    similar to the column of the same name in the tcrules file. This
    column allows filtering by MARK and CONNMARK value (CONNMARK is
    only accepted under Shorewall Perl).

5)  SOURCE and DEST are now reserved zone names to avoid problems with
    bi-directional macro definitions which use these as names as key
    words.

6)  The "shorewall show zones" command now flags zone members that have
    been added using "shorewall add" by preceding them with a plus sign
    ("+").

    Example:

    Shorewall 3.9.4 Zones at gateway - Mon May 14 07:48:16 PDT 2007

    fw (firewall)
    net (ipv4)
        eth0:0.0.0.0/0
    loc (ipv4)
	br0:0.0.0.0/0
	eth4:0.0.0.0/0
	eth5:0.0.0.0/0
	+eth1:0.0.0.0/0
    dmz (ipv4)
	eth3:0.0.0.0/0
    vpn (ipv4)
	tun+:0.0.0.0/0

    In the above output, "eth1:0.0.0.0/0" was dynamically added to the
    'loc' zone. As part of this change, "shorewall delete" will only
    delete entries that have been added dynamically. In earlier
    versions, any entry could be deleted although the ruleset was only
    changed by deleting entries that had been added dynamically.

7)  The 'shorewall version' command now lists the version of the
    installed compiler(s) if the -a option is used:

    gateway:/bulk/backup # shorewall version -a
    4.0.0-Beta1
    Shorewall-shell 4.0.0-Beta1
    Shorewall-perl 4.0.0-Beta1
    gateway:/bulk/backup #

8)  The Perl compiler is externalized. Both the compiler.pl program
    and the Perl Module interface are documented.

    The compiler program is /usr/share/shorewall-perl/compiler.pl:

	compiler.pl [ <option> ... ] [ <filename> ]

    If a <filename> is given, then the configuration will be compiled
    output placed in the named file. If <filename> is not given, then
    the configuration will simply be syntax checked.

    Options are:

    -v <verbosity>
    --verbosity=<verbosity>
    
	The <verbosity> is a number between 0 and 2 and corresponds to
	the VERBOSITY setting in shorewall.conf. This setting controls
	the verbosity of the compiler itself.

    -e
    --export

	If given, the configuration will be compiled for export to
	another system.

    -d <directory>
    --directory=<directory>

	If this option is omitted, the configuration in /etc/shorewall
	is compiled/checked. Otherwise, the configuration in the named
	directory will be compiled/checked.

    -t
    --timestamp

	If given, each progress message issued by the compiler and by
	the compiled program will be timestamped.

    --debug

	If given, when a warning or error message is issued, it is 
	supplimented with a stack trace. Requires the Carp Perl
	module.

    --refresh=<chainlist>

	If given, the compiled script's 'refresh' command will refresh
	the chains in the comma-separated <chainlist> rather than
	'blacklst'.

    Example (compiles the configuration in the current directory 
             generating a script named 'firewall' and using VERBOSITY
             2).

       /usr/share/shorewall-perl/compiler.pl -v 2 -d . firewall

    Note: For compatibility with the Shorewall 3.4.2 and 3.4.3
    releases, options not passed on the run-line get their values from
    environmental variables:

	   Option                 Variable

	   --verbosity		  VERBOSE
	   --export		  EXPORT
	   --directory		  SHOREWALL_DIR
	   --timestamp		  TIMESTAMP

    The Perl Module is externalized as follows:

	use lib '/usr/share/shorewall-perl';
	use Shorewall::Compiler;
	
	    compiler $filename, $directory, $verbose, $options $chains

    The arguments to the compiler function are as follows:

	$filename -   Name of the compiled script to be created.
                      If the arguments evaluates to false, the
                      configuration is syntax checked
		      
        $directory -  The directory containing the configuration.
		      If passed as '', then /etc/shorewall/ is assumed.

	$verbose -    The verbosity level (0-2).

	$options -    A bitmap of options. Shorewall::Compiler
                      exports two constants to help building this
		      argument:

			EXPORT    = 0x01
			TIMESTAMP = 0x02

        $chains -     A comma-separated list of chains that the
                      generated script's 'refresh' command will
                      reload.

    The compiler raises an exception with 'die' if it encounters an
    error; $@ contains the 'ERROR' messages describing the problem.
    
    The compiler function can be called repeatedly with different
    inputs.

9)  When TC_ENABLED=Internal, Shorewall-perl now validates classids in
    the MARK/CLASSIFY column of /etc/shorewall/tcrules against the
    classes generated by /etc/shorewall/tcclasses.

10) During installation, Shorewall generates the Perl module
    /usr/share/shorewall-perl/Shorewall/Ports.pm, using your
    /etc/protocols and /etc/services as input.

    To re-generate the module from those two files:

	1. Backup your current /usr/share/shorewall-perl/Shorewall/Ports.pm
	   file.
        2. /usr/share/shorewall-perl/buildports.pl > \
	   /usr/share/shorewall-perl/Shorewall/Ports.pm

    Note: If the buildports.pl program fails to run to a successful
    completion during installation, a fallback version of
    module will be installed. That fallback module was generated from
    the /etc/protocols and /etc/services shipped with Ubuntu Feisty
    Fawn.

    Even if the buildports.pl program runs successfully, the fallback
    module is also installed as
    /usr/share/shorewall-perl/Shorewall/FallbackPorts.pm. So if you
    encounter problems with the generated module, simply copy the
    fallback module to /usr/share/shorewall-perl/Shorewall/Ports.pm.

11) Tuomo Soini has contributed bi-directional macros for various
    tunnel types:

	  IPsecah
	  GRE
	  IPsec
	  IPIP
	  IPsecnat
	  L2TP

12) The -f option is no longer the default when Shorewall is started at
    boot time (usually via /etc/init.d/shorewall). With Shorewall-perl,
    "shorewall start" is nearly as fast as "shorewall restore" and
    "shorewall start" uses the current configuration which avoids
    confusion.

13) The implementation of LITEDIR has always been
    unsatisfactory. Furthermore, there have been other cases where
    people have asked to be able to designate the state directory
    (default /var/lib/shorewall[-lite]).

    To meet these objectives:

    a)  The LITEDIR variable has been eliminated in
        /usr/share/shorewall[-lite]/configpath.

    b)  A new file /etc/shorewall[-lite]/vardir has been added. This
        file is not created by default but may be added as needed. It
        is expected to contain a single variable assignment:

	   VARDIR=<directory>

	Example:

	   VARDIR=/root/shorewall
    
    To change VARDIR, copy the old directory to the new one before you
    restart Shorewall[-lite].

    To use this feature with Shorewall-lite, all packages involved
    (compiler, shorewall-common and shorewall-lite) must be version
    4.0.0-RC2 or later.

Problems corrected in 4.0.1.

1)  The Shorewall Lite installer was producing an empty shorewall-lite
    manpage. Since the installer runs as part of creating the RPM, the
    RPM also suffered from this problem. The 4.0.0 Shorewall-lite 
    packages were re-uploaded with this problem corrected.

2)  The Shorewall Lite uninstaller incorrectly removed /sbin/shorewall
    rather than /sbin/shorewall-lite.

3)  Both the Shorewall and Shorewall Lite uninstallers did a "shorewall
    clear" if Shorewall [Lite] was running. Now, the Shorewall Lite
    uninstaller correctly does "shorewall-lite clear" and both
    uninstallers only perform the 'clear' operation if the other
    product is not installed. This prevents the removal of one of the
    two products from clearing the firewall configuration established
    by the other one.

4)  The 'ipsec' OPTION in /etc/shorewall/hosts was mis-handled by
    Shorewall-perl. If the zone type was changed to 'ipsec' or
    'ipsec4' and the 'ipsec' option removed from the hosts file entry,
    the configuration worked properly.

5)  If a CLASSID was specified in a tcrule and TC_ENABLED=No, then
    Shorewall-perl produced the following:

    Compiling...
    Use of uninitialized value in string ne at /usr/share/shorewall-perl/Shorewall/Tc.pm line 285, <$currentfile> line 18.
       ERROR: Class Id n:m is not associated with device eth0 : /etc/shorewall/tcrules (line 18)

6)  If IPTABLES was not specified in shorewall.conf, Shorewall-perl was
    locating the binary using the PATH environmental variable rather
    than the PATH setting in shorewall.conf.  If no PATH was available
    when Shorewall-perl was run and IPTABLES was not set in
    shorewall.conf, the following messages were issued:

    Use of uninitialized value in split at /usr/share/shorewall-perl/Shorewall/Config.pm line 1054.
       ERROR: Can't find iptables executable
       ERROR: Shorewall restart failed

7)  If the "Mangle FORWARD Chain" capability was supported, entries in
    the /etc/shorewall/ecn file would cause invalid iptables commands
    to be generated. This problem occurred with both compilers.

8)  Shorewall now starts at reboot after an upgrade from shorewall <
    4.0.0. Previously, Shorewall was not started automatically at
    reboot after an upgrade using the RPM.

9)  Shorewall-perl was generating invalid iptables-restore input when a
    log level was specified with the dropBcast and allowBcast builtin
    actions and when a log level followed by '!' was used with any
    builtin actions.

10) Shorewall-perl was incorrectly rejecting 'min' as a valid unit of
    time in rate-limiting specifications.

11) Certain errors occurring during
    start/restart/safe-start/safe-restart/try processing could cause
    the lockfile to be left behind. This resulted in a 60-second delay
    the next time one of these commands was run.

Other changes in Shorewall 4.0.1.

1)  A new EXPAND_POLICIES option is added to shorewall.conf. The
    option is recognized by Shorewall-perl and is ignored by
    Shorewall-shell.

    Normally, when the SOURCE or DEST columns in shorewall-policy(5)
    contains 'all', a single policy chain is created and the policy is
    enforced in that chain. For example, if the policy entry is

	     #SOURCE DEST POLICY LOG
	     #                   LEVEL
	     net     all  DROP   info

    then the chain name is 'net2all' which is also the chain named in
    Shorewall log messages generated as a result of the policy. If
    EXPAND_POLICIES=Yes, then Shorewall-perl will create a separate
    chain for each pair of zones covered by the policy. This makes the
    resulting log messages easier to interpret since the chain in the
    messages will have a name of the form 'a2b' where 'a' is the SOURCE
    zone and 'b' is the DEST zone. See
    http://linuxman.wikispaces.com/PPPPPPS for more information.

2)  The Shorewall-perl dependency on the "Address Type Match"
    capability has been relaxed. This allows Shorewall 4.0.1 to be used
    on releases like RHEL4 that don't support that capability.

3)  Shorewall-perl now detects dead policy file entries that result
    when an entry is masked by an earlier entry. Example:

	 all	 all	  REJECT    info
	 loc	 net	  ACCEPT

4)  Recent kernels are apparently hard to configure and we have been
    seeing a lot of problem reports where the root cause is the lack of
    state match support in the kernel. This problem is difficult to
    diagnose when using Shorewall-perl so the generated shell program
    now checks specifically for this problem and terminates with an
    error if the capability doesn't exist.

Problems corrected in 4.0.2

1)  The Shorewall-perl compiler was still generating invalid
    iptables-restore input from entries in /etc/shorewall/ecn.

2)  When using Shorewall-perl, unless an interface was specified as
    'optional' in the interfaces file, the 'restore' command would
    fail if the routes through the interface or the addresses on the
    interface could not be detected.

    Route detection occurs when the interface is named in the SOURCE
    column of the masq file. Address detection occurs when
    DETECT_DNAT_IPADDRS=Yes and the interface is the SOURCE for a DNAT
    or REDIRECT rule or when 'maclist' is specified for the interface.
   
    Since the 'restore' command doesn't use the detected information,
    detection is now skipped if the command is 'restore'.

3)  It was not previously possible to define traffic shaping on a
    bridge port; the generated script complained that the
    interface was not up and configured.

4)  When Shorewall-shell was not installed, certain options in
    /etc/shorewall/interfaces and /etc/shorewall/hosts would cause the
    'add' and 'delete' commands to fail with a missing library error.

	  OPTION               FILE
	  maclist	       interfaces,hosts
	  proxyarp	       interfaces

5)  The /var/lib/shorewall/zones file was being overwritten during
    processing of the 'refresh' command by a script generated with
    Shorewall-perl. The result was that hosts previously added to
    dynamic zones could not be deleted after the 'refresh'.

6)  If the file named as the output file in a Shorewall-perl 'compile'
    command was a symbolic link, the generated error message
    erroneously stated that the file's parent directory was a symbolic
    link.

    As part of this change, cosmetic changes were made to a number of
    other error messages.

7)  Some intra-zone rules were missing when a zone involved multiple
    interfaces or when a zone included both IPSEC and non-IPSEC
    networks.

8)  Shorewall was not previously loading the xt_multiport kernel
    module.

9)  The Russian and French translations no longer have English headings
    on notes, cautions, etc..

10) Previously, using a port list in the DEST PORT(S) column of the
    rules file or in an action file could cause an invalid iptables
    command to be generated by Shorewall-shell.

11) If there were no bridges in a configuration, Shorewall-perl would
    ignore the CHAIN column in /etc/shorewall/accounting.

Other changes in 4.0.2

1)  Shorewall-perl now detects when a port range is included in a list
    of ports and iptables/kernel support for Extended Multi-port Match
    is not available. This avoids an iptables-restore failure at
    run-time.

2)  Most chains created by Shorewall-shell have names that can be
    embedded within shell variable names. This is a workaround for
    limitations in the shell programming language which has no
    equivalent to Perl hashes. Often chain names must have the name of
    a network interface encoded in them. Given that interface names can
    contain characters that are invalid in a shell variable name,
    Shorewall-shell performs a name mapping which was carried forward to
    Shorewall-perl:

    - Trailing '+' is dropped.
    - The characters ".", "-", "%' and "@" are translated to "_".

    This mapping has been elminated in the 4.0.2 release of Shorewall-
    perl. So where before you would see chain "eth0_0_in", you may now
    see the same chain named "eth0.0_in". Similarly, a chain previously
    named "ppp_fwd" may now be called "ppp+_fwd".

3)  Shorewall-perl now uses the contents of the BROADCAST column in
    /etc/shorewall/interfaces when the Address Type match capability is
    not available.

Problems Corrected in 4.0.3

1) Using the LOG target in the rules file could result in two LOG
   rules being generated by Shorewall-shell. Additionally, using an IP
   address range in a rule that performed logging could result in an
   invalid iptables command.

2)  Shorewall now loads the act_police kernel module needed by traffic
    shaping.

3)  Previously, "shorewall show -f capabilities" and "shorecap" omitted
    the "TCPMSS Match" capability. This made it appear to a compiler
    using a capabilities file that the TCPMSS Match capability was not
    available.

4)  Previously, Shorewall would truncate long log prefixes to 29
    characters. This resulted in there being no space between the log
    prefix and the IN= part of the message.

    Example: fw2net:LOG:HTTPSoutIN= OUT=eth0

    Beginning with this release, Shorewall will truncate the prefix to
    28 bytes and add a trailing space.

    Example: fw2net:LOG:HTTPSou IN= OUT=eth0

5)  Previously, if:

    - FASTACCEPT=No
    - The policy from Z1 to Z2 was CONTINUE
    - Neither Z1 nor Z2 had parent zones
    - There were no Z1->Z2 rules

    then connections from Z2->Z1 would fail even if there were
    rules/policies allowing them. This has been
    corrected.

6)  The 'shorewall add' and 'shorewall delete' command would fail when:

    - The running configuration was compiled with Shorewall-perl.
    - The name of the interface specified in the command contained an
      embedded special character such as '.' or '-'.

    This problem was the result of the change in Shorewall 4.0.2 that
    removed the legacy mapping of interface names when embedding such
    names in a Netfilter chain name. To correct the problem, the
    pre-4.0.2 name mapping is restored when DYNAMIC_ZONES=Yes.

5)  A bug in Shorewall-shell prevented proper handling of PREROUTING
    marks when HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=No and the track option was specified
    in /etc/shorewall/providers.

6)  With Shorewall-perl, if EXPORTPARAMS=Yes then INCLUDE directives in
    the params file would fail at script execution time with "INCLUDE:
    not found". This has been corrected.

7)  Shorewall-perl was mis-sorting the zone list when zones were nested
    more than one deep.

8)  Stale references to http://www.shorewall.net/Documentation.htm have
    been removed from the config files (including samples). That URL
    has been replaced by the online manpages.

Other Changes in 4.0.3

1)  A script generated by Shorewall-perl now tries to modify/restore
    /etc/iproute2/rt_tables only if the file is writable. This prevents
    run-time errors when /etc is mounted read-only.
  
    A new KEEP_RT_TABLES option has been added to shorewall.conf. When
    set to Yes, this option prevents Shorewall from altering the
    /etc/iproute2/rt_tables database. The KEEP_RT_TABLES option is only
    recognized by Shorewall-perl and is ignored by Shorewall-shell.

2)  Shorewall-perl now requires the FindBin Perl module.

3)  When an optional provider is not available, a script generated by
    Shorewall-perl will no longer add the corresponding
    routing rules.

4)  A new 'isusable' extension script has been added. This script
    allows you to extend the availability test that Shorewall performs
    on optional providers.

    Here's an example that uses ping to ensure that the default
    gateways through eth0 and eth1 are reachable:

    case $1 in
        eth0)
	    ping -c 4 -I eth0 206.124.146.254 > /dev/null 2>&1
            return
           ;;
        eth1)
            ping -c 4 -I eth1 192.168.12.254 > /dev/null 2>&1
            return
            ;;
        *)
            # Assume we don't need to do any additional testing
	    # for this interface beyond Shorewall's
	    return 0
	    ;;
    esac

    Additional information is available at
    http://www.shorewall.net/shorewall_extension_scripts.htm.

5)  Processing of the message log in the 'show log', 'logwatch' and
    'dump' commands has been speeded up thanks to a suggestion by
    Andrew Suffield.

6)  Beginning with Shorewall 4.0, the shorewall 'stop', and 'clear'
    commands were processed by the generated script from the
    last successful 'start', 'restart' or 'refresh' command. This had
    the side effect that updates to the /etc/shorewall/routestopped
    file did not take effect until one of those three commands was
    successfully processed.

    Beginning with Shorewall 4.0.3, the old 3.x behavior is restored as
    the default and the 4.0 behavior is enabled using the '-f' command
    option.

    Example: shorewall stop -f

7)  An 'mss' option has been added to the interfaces file. This option
    is only recognized by Shorewall-perl and causes Shorewall to set
    the MSS field in forwarded TCP SYN packets going in or out the
    interface to the value that you specify.

    Example:

    #ZONE	INTERFACE	BROADCAST	OPTIONS
    vpn		ppp0		-		mss=1400

    The mss option only affects incoming traffic that has not been
    decrypted by IPSEC and outgoing traffic that will not subsequently
    be encrypted by IPSEC. The MSS for IPSEC traffic is managed by the
    'mss' option in /etc/shorewall/zones.

8)  Shorewall now detects the presence of the 'hashlimit match'
    capability. There is no builtin support yet for hashlimit but
    detection allows extension scripts for user-supplied actions to
    determine if the capability exists.

    With Shorewall-shell, $HASHLIMIT_MATCH will be non-empty if the
    capability exists.

    With Shorewall-perl, $capabilities{HASHLIMIT_MATCH} will be true in
    a boolean context if the capability exists. Shorewall-perl users
    may also code the following in their extension script:

    use Shorewall::Config;

    require_capability( 'HASHLIMIT_MATCH',      #Capability
                        'My hashlimit action' , #Feature requiring 
						#capability
			's' );                  #Feature is singular
                                                #(if plural, pass the
						  empty string)

    That call would procduce the following fatal error if the
    capability isn't available:

    ERROR: My hashlimit action requires the Hashlimit match capability
           in your kernel and iptables

9)  NFQUEUE support has been added to Shorewall-perl.

    NFQUEUE may appear in actions, macros, rules and as a policy.
    When NFQUEUE is used by itself, queue number zero is assumed. To
    specify a queue number, follow NFQUEUE by a slash ("/") and the
    queue number.

    Examples (/etc/shorewall/rules):

    NFQUEUE		loc	net	tcp #Queue number 0
    NFQUEUE/22		loc	net	udp #Queue number 22
    NFQUEUE/22:info	loc	net	gre #With logging

    An NFQUEUE_DEFAULT option has been added to shorewall.conf for
    specifying the default action to use with NFQUEUE policies.

    Use of NFQUEUE requires the NFQUEUE Target capability in your
    kernel/iptables. If you intend to use NFQUEUE with Shorewall-lite,
    then you must install Shorewall-lite 4.0.3 in order to build a
    capabilities file that includes NFQUEUE Target. If your
    capabilities file was generated by a Shorewall/Shorewall-lite
    version earlier that 4.0.3, you will receive a warning during
    compilation.

10) The 'refresh' command can now refresh chains other than 'blacklst'.

    The syntax of the command is now:

	shorewall refresh [ <chain> ... ]

    If no <chain> is given then 'blacklst' is assumed. Otherwise, the
    Shorewall-perl compiler compiles a script whose 'refresh' command
    refreshes the listed <chain>(s).

    The listed chains are assumed to be in the filter table. You can
    refresh chains in other tables by prefixing the chain name with the
    table name followed by ":" (e.g., nat:net_dnat). Chain names which
    follow are assumed to be in that table until the end of the list or
    until an entry in the list names another table.

    This feature requires Shorewall-perl 4.0.3 as well as
    Shorewall-common 4.0.3.
