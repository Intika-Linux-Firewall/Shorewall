Shorewall 4.3.3

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
               R E L E A S E  4 . 3  H I G H L I G H T S
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Support is included for IPv6.

   Minimun system requirements:

   - Kernel 2.6.20 or later with 2.6.25 or later strongly recommended.
   - iptables 1.4.0 or later with 1.4.1 strongly recommended.
   - Perl 5.10 if you wish to use DNS names in your IPv6 config files. 
     In that case you will also have to install Perl Socket6 support.

Problems Corrected in 4.3.3

None.

Other changes in 4.3.3

1)  In as much as ip6tables doesn't support the ECN target, the 'ecn'
    file has been removed and its processing disabled. 

2)  The 'maclist' option is now supported in /etc/shorewall6/interfaces
    and in /etc/shorewall6/hosts.

    MAC verification is not performed on the following IPv6 traffic:

    a) Multicast.
    b) Source or destination is a link-level address (ff80::/10).

Migration Issues.

   None.

New Features in Shorewall 4.3

1) Two new packages are included:

   a) Shorewall6 - analagous to Shorewall-common but handles IPv6
      rather than IPv4.

   b) Shorewall6-lite - analagous to Shorewall-lite but handles IPv6
      rather than IPv4.

   The packages store their configurations in /etc/shorewall6/ and
   /etc/shorewall6-lite/ respectively.  

   The fact that the packages are separate from their IPv4 counterparts
   means that you control IPv4 and IPv6 traffic separately (the same
   way that Netfilter does). Starting/Stopping the firewall for one
   address family has no effect on the other address family.

   Other features of Shorewall6 are:

   a) There is no NAT of any kind (most people see this as a giant step
      forward). When an ISP assigns you a public IPv6 address, you are
      actually assigned an IPv6 'prefix' which is like an IPv4
      subnet. A 64-bit prefix allows 4 billion squared individual hosts
      (the size of the current IPv4 address space squared).

   b) The default zone type is ipv6.

   c) The currently-supported interface options in Shorewall6 are:

	blacklist
        bridge
	dhcp
	nosmurfs
	optional
	routeback
	sourceroute
        tcpflags
	mss
	forward (setting it to 0 makes the router behave like a host
                 on that interface rather than like a router).

   d)  The currently-supported host options in Shorewall6 are:

	blacklist
	routeback
	tcpflags

   e)  Traffic Shaping is currently disabled. Packet marking and
       connection marking are available to feed your current traffic
       shaping defined in Shorewall.

   f)  When both an interface and an address or address list need to
       be specified in a rule, the address or list must be enclosed in
       square brackets. Example:

        #ACTION      SOURCE		                        DEST
	ACCEPT	     net:eth0:[2001:19f0:feee::dead:beef:cafe]	dmz

       Note that this includes MAC addresses as well as IPv6 addresses.

       The HOSTS column in /etc/shorewall6/hosts also uses this
       convention:

           #ZONE      HOSTS					OPTIONS
           chat6      eth0:[2001:19f0:feee::dead:beef:cafe]

       Even when an interface is not specified, it is permitted to
       enclose addresses in [] to improve readability. Example:

           #ACTION      SOURCE		DEST
	   ACCEPT	net:[2001:1::1]	$FW

   g)  There are currently no Shorewall6 or Shorewall6-lite manpages.

   h)  The options available in shorewall6.conf are a subset of those
       available in shorewall.conf.

   i)  The Socket6.pm Perl module is required if you include DNS names
       in your Shorewall6 configuration. Note that it is loaded the
       first time that a DNS name is encountered so if it is missing,
       you get a message similar to this one:

       ...
       Checking /etc/shorewall6/rules...
       Can't locate Socket6.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /root ...
       teastep@ursa:~/Configs/standalone6$
