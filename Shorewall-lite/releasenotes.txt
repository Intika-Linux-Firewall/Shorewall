New Features:

Shorewall Lite is a companion product to Shorewall and is designed to
allow you to maintain all Shorewall configuration information on a
single system within your network.

a) You install the full Shorewall release on one system within your
network. You need not configure Shorewall there and you may totally
disable startup of Shorewall in your init scripts. For ease of
reference, we call this system the 'administrative system'.

b) On each system where you wish to run a Shorewall-generated firewall,
you install Shorewall Lite. For ease of reference, we will call these
systems the 'firewall systems'

c) On the administrative system you create a separate 'configuration
directory' for each firewall system. You copy the contents of
/usr/share/shorewall/configfiles into each configuration directory.

d) On each firewall system, you run these two commands:

       /usr/share/shorewall/shorecap > capabilities
       scp capabilities <admin system>:<this system's config dir>

   If you are running Debian or one of its derivatives like Ubuntu then 
   edit /etc/default/shorewall-lite and set startup=1.

   Shorewall Lite includes a very limited version of shorewall.conf
   (/etc/shorewall-lite/shorewall.conf). It includes the following
   options which have the same meaning as in a full Shorewall
   installation except as noted below:

	VERBOSITY
	LOGFILE
	LOGFORMAT - used by /sbin/shorewall for finding 'Shorewall' log
		    messages. If LOGFORMAT was specified in the
		    shorewall.conf file used at compile time on the
		    administrative system, then the format of the
		    messages themselves is defined by that value. If
		    LOGFORMAT was not specified at compile time then
		    the firewall script will use the value from
		    /etc/shorewall-lite/shorewall.conf on the firewall
		    system.
	IPTABLES - determines the iptables binary to be used by
		   /sbin/shorewall. The compiled firewall script will
		   use the IPTABLES specified in shorewall.conf at
		   compile time on the administrative system, if any;
		   if IPTABLES was not specified at compile time then
		   the IPTABLES value from
		   /etc/shorewall-lite/shorewall.conf on the firewall
		   system will be used by the firewall script.
	PATH
	SHOREWALL_SHELL
	SUBSYSLOCK
	RESTOREFILE

    Edit the shorewall.conf file as required.

e) On the administrative system, for each firewall system you:

   1) modify the files in the corresponding configuration
      directory appropriately.

   2) (this may be done as a non-root user)

      cd <configuration directory>
      /sbin/shorewall load . <firewall system>

   3) If you need to change the configuration, after you
      have modified the configuration:

      cd <configuration directory>
      /sbin/shorewall reload . <firewall system>

It is possible to have both shorewall and Shorewall Lite
installed on the same system.
