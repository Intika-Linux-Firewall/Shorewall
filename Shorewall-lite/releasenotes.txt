Shorewall Lite 3.2.0 RC 4

Problems Corrected in 3.2.0 RC 4

1)  RESTOREFILE has been added to shorewall.conf.

2)  Many references to incorrect file names and commands have been
    corrected in shorewall.conf.

3)  /sbin/shorewall-lite still supported the 'refresh' command
    whereas the firewall script generated by 'compile' did not.
    This lead to the following:

        gateway:~ # shorewall-lite refresh
        Usage: /usr/share/shorewall-lite/firewall [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ] [ start|stop|clear|restart|status|version ]
        gateway:~ #

Other changes in 3.2.0 RC 4

1)  The progress messages produced by Shorewall Lite now correctly
    identify the product as 'Shorewall Lite' rather than
    'Shorewall'. In order for this to work, you must have Shorewall RC4
    installed on your administrative system(s) and Shorewall Lite RC4
    on the firewall system(s).

2)  To appease the LHS police, the file
    /usr/share/shorewall-lite/firewall has been moved to
    /var/lib/shorewall-lite/firewall. When upgrading to this release of
    Shorewall Lite, please execute the following command:

    cp -a /usr/share/shorewall-lite/firewall /var/lib/shorewall-lite/

New Features:

Shorewall Lite is a companion product to Shorewall and is designed to
allow you to maintain all Shorewall configuration information on a
single system within your network.

a) You install the full Shorewall release on one system within your
network. You need not configure Shorewall there and you may totally
disable startup of Shorewall in your init scripts. For ease of
reference, we call this system the 'administrative system'.

b) On each system where you wish to run a Shorewall-generated firewall,
you install Shorewall Lite. For ease of reference, we will call these
systems the 'firewall systems'

c) On the administrative system you create a separete 'configuration
directory' for each firewall system. You copy the contents of
/usr/share/shorewall/configfiles into each configuration directory.

d) On each firewall system, you run:

   /usr/share/shorewall/shorecap > capabilities
   scp capabilities <admin system>:<this system's config dir>

e) On the administrative system, for each firewall system you:

   1) modify the files in the corresponding configuration
      directory appropriately.

   2) (this may be done as a non-root user)

      cd <configuration directory>
      /sbin/shorewall compile -e . firewall
      scp firewall root@<firewall system>:/var/lib/shorewall-lite/

   3) On the firewall system, 'shorewall-lite start'.

It is possible to have both shorewall and Shorewall Lite
installed on the same system.
