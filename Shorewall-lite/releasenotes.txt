Shorewall Lite 3.2.0 RC 3

Problems Corrected in 3.2.0 RC 2

1)  The /usr/share/shorewall-lite/configpath file has been corrected to
    correctly refer to /usr/share/shorewall-lite/.

2)  The /etc/shorewall-lite/Makefile has been corrected to refer to the
    proper directories.

3)  The /usr/share/shorewall-lite/shorecap program has been corrected
    to refer to the proper directories and to correct a typo that
    prevented the program for detecting any capabilities.

Other changes in 3.2.0 RC 3

None.

New Features:

Shorewall Lite is a companion product to Shorewall and is designed to
allow you to maintain all Shorewall configuration information on a
single system within your network.

a) You install the full Shorewall release on one system within your
network. You need not configure Shorewall there and you may totally
disable startup of Shorewall in your init scripts. For ease of
reference, we call this system the 'administrative system'.

b) On each system where you wish to run a Shorewall-generated firewall,
you install Shorewall Lite. For ease of reference, we will call these
systems the 'firewall systems'.

c) On the administrative system you create a separete 'configuration
directory' for each firewall system. You copy the contents of
/usr/share/shorewall/configfiles into each configuration directory.

d) On each firewall system, you run:

   /usr/share/shorewall/shorecap > capabilities
   scp capabilities <admin system>:<this system's config dir>

e) On the administrative system, for each firewall system you:

   1) modify the files in the corresponding configuration
      directory appropriately.

   2) (this may be done as a non-root user)

      cd <configuration directory>
      /sbin/shorewall compile -e . firewall
      scp firewall root@<firewall system>:/usr/share/shorewall/

   3) On the firewall system, 'shorewall start'.

It is possible to have both shorewall and Shorewall Lite 
installed on the same system if you use RPM. Regardless of whether
you use RPM or the installer, Shorewall Lite directory names have
been change from 'shorewall' to 'shorewall-lite':

      /etc/shorewall -> /etc/shorewall-lite
       /usr/share/shorewall -> /usr/share/shorewall-lite
        /var/lib/shorewall -> /var/lib/shorewall-lite

If you use the RPMs, whichever package is installed first will
determine which package /sbin/shorewall invokes. /sbin/shorewall is
now a symbolic link created by 'rpm':

Shorewall: /sbin/shorewall points to /usr/share/shorewall/shorewall
Shorewall Lite:
        /sbin/shorewall points to /usr/share/shorewall/shorewall-lite

You may use the 'ln -sf' command to change from one to the other:

To use 'Shorewall' rather than 'Shorewall Lite'

        ln -sf /usr/share/shorewall/shorewall /sbin/shorewall

To use 'Shorewall Lite' rather than 'Shorewall'

        ln -sf /usr/share/shorewall-lite/shorewall /sbin/shorewall
