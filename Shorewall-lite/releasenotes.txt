None.

New Features:

Shorewall Lite is a companion product to Shorewall and is designed to
allow you to maintain all Shorewall configuration information on a
single system within your network.

a) You install the full Shorewall release on one system within your
network. You need not configure Shorewall there and you may totally
disable startup of Shorewall in your init scripts. For ease of
reference, we call this system the 'administrative system'.

b) On each system where you wish to run a Shorewall-generated firewall,
you install Shorewall Lite. For ease of reference, we will call these
systems the 'firewall systems'.

c) On the administrative system you create a separete 'configuration
directory' for each firewall system. You copy the contents of
/usr/share/shorewall/configfiles into each configuration directory.

d) On each firewall system, you run:

   /usr/share/shorewall/shorecap > capabilities

   The 'capabilities' file is then copied to the corresponding
   configuration directory on the administrative system.

e) On the administrative system, for each firewall system you:

   1) modify the files in the corresponding configuration
      directory appropriately.

   2) As a non-root user:

      cd <configuration directory>
      /sbin/shorewall compile . firewall
      
      Then copy the compiled 'firewall' script to
      /usr/share/shorewall/firewall on the corresponding firewall
      system.

   3) On the firewall system, 'shorewall start'.
