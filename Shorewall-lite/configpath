# SHOREWALL LITE'S FIREWALL SCRIPT DIRECTORY
#
# There is lack of agreement about where exactly in the file hierarchy the 
# firewall script in Shorewall Lite systems should be stored. To allow 
# everyone's opinion to prevail (and to prevent the Shorewall author from
# going crazy), the LITEDIR option allows you to decide where the file will
# be stored on Shorewall Lite systems under your distribution.
#
# a) You *must* set a value for this option
# b) The same value must be configured in
#    /usr/share/shorewall/configpath in your Shorewall package
#    system(s).

LITEDIR=/var/lib/shorewall-lite
