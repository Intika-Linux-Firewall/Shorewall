# Shorewall has traditionally been very noisy. You may now set the default
# level of verbosity here.
#
# Values are:
#
#         0 -- Silent. You may make it more verbose using the -v option
#         1 -- Major progress messages displayed
#         2 -- All progress messages displayed (old default behavior)
#
# If not specified, then 2 is assumed

#
# General note about log levels. Log levels are a method of describing
# to syslog (8) the importance of a message and a number of parameters
# in this file have log levels as their value.
#
# These levels are defined by syslog and are used to determine the destination
# of the messages through entries in /etc/syslog.conf (5). The syslog
# documentation refers to these as "priorities"; Netfilter calls them "levels"
# and Shorewall also uses that term.
#
# Valid levels are:
#
#	7	debug
#	6	info
#	5	notice
#	4	warning
#	3	err
#	2	crit
#	1	alert
#	0	emerg
#
# For most Shorewall logging, a level of 6 (info) is appropriate. Shorewall
# log messages are generated by NetFilter and are logged using facility
# 'kern' and the level that you specifify. If you are unsure of the level
# to choose, 6 (info) is a safe bet. You may specify levels by name or by
# number.
#
# If you have built your kernel with ULOG target support, you may also
# specify a log level of ULOG (must be all caps). Rather than log its
# messages to syslogd, Shorewall will direct netfilter to log the messages
# via the ULOG target which will send them to a process called 'ulogd'.
# ulogd is available with most Linux distributions (although it probably isn't
# installed by default). Ulogd is also available from
# http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd and can be configured to log all
# Shorewall message to their own log file

#
# LOG FILE LOCATION
#
# This variable tells the /sbin/shorewall program where to look for Shorewall
# log messages. If not set or set to an empty string (e.g., LOGFILE="") then
# /var/log/messages is assumed.
#
# WARNING: The LOGFILE variable simply tells the 'shorewall' program where to
#	   look for Shorewall messages.It does NOT control the destination for
#	   these messages. For information about how to do that, see
#
#	       http://www.shorewall.net/shorewall_logging.html
#

LOGFILE=/var/log/messages

#
# LOG FORMAT
#
# Shell 'printf' Formatting template for the --log-prefix value in log messages
# generated by Shorewall to identify Shorewall log messages. The supplied
# template is expected to accept either two or three arguments; the first is
# the chain name, the second (optional) is the logging rule number within that
# chain and the third is the ACTION specifying the disposition of the packet
# being logged. You must use the %d formatting type for the rule number; if
# your template does not contain %d then the rule number will not be included.
#
# If you want to integrate Shorewall with fireparse, then set LOGFORMAT as:
#
#	LOGFORMAT="fp=%s:%d a=%s "
#
# If not specified or specified as empty (LOGFORMAT="") then the value
# "Shorewall:%s:%s:" is assumed.
#
# CAUTION: /sbin/shorewall uses the leading part of the LOGFORMAT string (up
# to but not including the first '%') to find log messages in the 'show log',
# 'status' and 'hits' commands. This part should not be omitted (the
# LOGFORMAT should not begin with "%") and the leading part should be
# sufficiently unique for /sbin/shorewall to identify Shorewall messages.
#

LOGFORMAT="Shorewall:%s:%s:"

# IPTABLES
#
# Full path to iptables executable Shorewall uses to build the firewall. If

# SUBSYSTEM LOCK FILE

# Set this to the name of the lock file expected by your init scripts. For
