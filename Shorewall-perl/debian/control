Description:  Shoreline Firewall, Netfilter configurator (Perl-based)
 Shorewall allows you to describe your firewall/gateway requirements
 using entries in a set of configuration files. It reads those
 configuration files and, with the help of the iptables utility,
 configures Netfilter to match your requirements.
 .
 Shorewall supports a wide range of router/firewall/gateway applications,
 traffic shaping and almost every type of VPN.
 .
 This version of Shorewall includes a rule compiler written in Perl.
