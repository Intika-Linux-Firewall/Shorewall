Lots of people try to download the entire Shorewall website for
off-line browsing, including the CVS portion. In addition to being an
enormous volume of data (HTML versions of all versions of all Shorewall
files), all of the pages in Shorewall CVS access are cgi-generated
which places a tremendous load on my little server. I have therefore
resorted to making CVS access password controlled. When you are asked
to log in, enter "Shorewall" (NOTE THE CAPITALIZATION!!!!!) for both
the user name and the password.<br>
