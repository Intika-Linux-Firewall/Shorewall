<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Given that I develop and support
Shorewall without asking for any
renumeration, I can hardly justify paying $200US+ a year to a
Certificate Authority such as Thawte (A Division of VeriSign) for an
X.509 certificate to prove that I am who I am. I have therefore
established my own Certificate Authority (CA) and sign my own X.509
certificates. I use these certificates on my list server (<a
 href="https://lists.shorewall.net">https://lists.shorewall.net</a>)
which hosts parts of this web site.<br>
<br>
X.509 certificates are the basis for the Secure Socket Layer (SSL). As
part of establishing an SSL session (URL https://...), your browser
verifies the X.509 certificate supplied by the HTTPS server against the
set of Certificate Authority Certificates that were shipped with your
browser. It is expected that the server's certificate was issued by one
of the authorities whose identities are known to your browser. <br>
<br>
This mechanism, while supposedly guaranteeing that when you connect to
https://www.foo.bar you are REALLY connecting to www.foo.bar, means
that the CAs literally have a license to print money -- they are
selling a string of bits (an X.509 certificate) for $200US+ per
year!!!I <br>
<br>
I wish that I had decided to become a CA rather that designing and
writing Shorewall.<br>
<br>
What does this mean to you? It means that the X.509 certificate that my
server will present to your browser will not have been signed by one of
the authorities known to your browser. If you try to connect to my
server using SSL, your browser will frown and give you a dialog box
asking if you want to accept the sleezy X.509 certificate being
presented by my server. <br>
<br>
There are two things that you can do:<br>
<ol>
  <li>You can accept the mail.shorewall.net certificate when your
browser asks -- your acceptence of the certificate can be temporary
(for that access only) or perminent.</li>
  <li>You can download and install <a href="ca.crt">my (self-signed)
CA certificate.</a> This will make my Certificate Authority known to
your browser so that it will accept any certificate signed by me. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
What are the risks?<br>
<ol>
  <li>If you install my CA certificate then you assume that I am
trustworthy and that Shorewall running on your firewall won't redirect
HTTPS requests intented to go to your bank's server to one of my
systems that will present your browser with a bogus certificate
claiming that my server is that of
your bank.</li>
  <li>If you only accept my server's certificate when prompted then the
most that you have to loose is that when you connect to
https://mail.shorewall.net, the server you are connecting to might not
be mine.</li>
</ol>
I have my CA certificate loaded into all of my browsers but I certainly
won't be offended if you decline to load it into yours... :-)<br>
