<h2>Mailing Lists are Moderated for Non-Member Posts</h2>
Given the
recent problems associated with the MyDoom virus (and the more annoying
problem of clueless mail admins who configure their AV software to spam
innocent bystanders during a virus storm), the Shorewall lists are now
moderated for non-member posts. It is also a good idea to mention that
you are a non-member so that people will include you in the CC list
when replying.
<h2>Please post in plain text</h2>
A growing number of MTAs serving list subscribers are rejecting all
HTML traffic. At least one MTA has gone so far as to blacklist
shorewall.net "for continuous abuse" because it has been my policy to
allow HTML in list posts!!<br>
<br>
I think that blocking all HTML is a Draconian way to control spam and
that the ultimate losers here are not the spammers but the list
subscribers whose MTAs are bouncing all shorewall.net mail. As one list
subscriber wrote to me privately "These e-mail admin's need to get a <i>(explitive
deleted)</i> life instead of trying to
rid the planet of HTML based e-mail". Nevertheless, to allow
subscribers to receive list posts as must as possible, I have now
configured the list server at shorewall.net to strip all HTML from
outgoing posts.
This means that HTML-only posts will be bounced by the list server.<br>
<p align="left"> <b>Note: </b>The list server limits posts to 120kb.<br>
</p>
<h2>Other Mail Delivery Problems</h2>
If you find that you are missing an occasional list post, your e-mail
admin may be blocking mail whose <i>Received:</i> headers contain the
names of certain ISPs. Again, I believe that such policies hurt more
than they help but I'm not prepared to go so far as to start stripping <i>Received:</i>
headers to circumvent those policies.<br>

<h2 align="left">Shorewall CA Certificate</h2>
If you want to trust X.509 certificates issued by Shoreline Firewall

in your browser. If you don't wish to trust my certificates then you
can either use unencrypted access when subscribing to Shorewall mailing
lists or you can use secure access (SSL) and
accept the server's certificate when prompted by your browser.<br>

<h2 align="left"><a name="Unsubscribe"></a>How to Unsubscribe from one
of the Mailing Lists</h2>
<p align="left">There seems to be near-universal confusion about
unsubscribing from Mailman-managed lists although Mailman 2.1 has
attempted to make this less confusing. To unsubscribe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Follow the same link above that you used to
subscribe to the list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Down at the bottom of that page is the following
text: " To <b>unsubscribe</b> from <i>&lt;list name&gt;</i>,
get a password reminder, or change your subscription options
enter your subscription email address:". Enter your email address in
the box and click on the "<b>Unsubscribe</b> or edit
options" button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">There will now be a box where you can enter your
password and click on "Unsubscribe"; if you have forgotten your
password, there is another button that will cause your password
to be emailed to you.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>A Word about the SPAM Filters at Shorewall.net&nbsp;<a
 href="http://osirusoft.com/"> </a></h2>
<p>Please note that the mail server at shorewall.net checks
incoming mail:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>against <a href="http://spamassassin.org">Spamassassin</a>
(including <a href="http://razor.sourceforge.net/">Vipul's Razor</a>).<br>
  </li>
  <li>to ensure that the sender address is
fully qualified.</li>
  <li>to verify that the sender's domain has an A or MX record in DNS.</li>
  <li>to ensure that the host name in the HELO/EHLO command is a valid
fully-qualified DNS name.</li>
</ol>
