      <h2>Introduction<br>
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.netfilter.org">Netfilter</a> - the
packet
filter facility built into the 2.4 and later Linux kernels.</li>
        <li>ipchains - the packet filter facility built into the 2.2
Linux
kernels. Also the name of the utility program used to configure and
control that facility. Netfilter can be used in ipchains
compatibility mode.<br>
        </li>
        <li>iptables - the utility program used to configure and
control
Netfilter. The term 'iptables' is often used to refer to the
combination of iptables+Netfilter (with Netfilter not in ipchains
compatibility mode).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as "Shorewall", is
high-level tool for configuring Netfilter. You describe your
firewall/gateway requirements using entries in a set of
configuration files. Shorewall reads those configuration files and
with the help of the iptables utility, Shorewall configures
Netfilter to match your requirements. Shorewall can be used on a
dedicated firewall system, a multi-function gateway/router/server
or on a standalone GNU/Linux system. Shorewall does not use
Netfilter's ipchains compatibility mode and can thus take advantage
of Netfilter's connection state tracking capabilities.

closely match your environment and follow the step by step
instructions.<br>
      <h2>Looking for Information?</h2>
The <a href="Documentation_Index.html">Documentation

      <h2>Running Shorewall on Mandrake with a two-interface setup?</h2>
If so, the documentation <b></b>on this site will not apply
directly to your setup. If you want to use the documentation that
you find here, you will want to consider uninstalling what you have
and installing a setup that matches the documentation on this site.

      <p>Problems Corrected since version 1.4.8:<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>There has been a low continuing level of confusion over the
terms "Source NAT" (SNAT) and "Static NAT". To avoid future
confusion, all instances of "Static NAT" have been replaced with
"One-to-one NAT" in the documentation and configuration files.</li>
        <li>The description of NEWNOTSYN in shorewall.conf has been
reworded for clarity.</li>
        <li>Wild-card rules (those involving "all" as SOURCE or DEST)
will
no longer produce an error if they attempt to add a rule that would
override a NONE policy. The logic for expanding these wild-card
rules now simply skips those (SOURCE,DEST) pairs that have a NONE
policy.</li>
        <li>DNAT rules that also specified SNAT now work reliably.
Previously,
there were cases where the SNAT specification was effectively ignored.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Migration Issues:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None.<br>
      <br>
New Features:<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The documentation has been completely rebased to Docbook
XML. The
documentation is now released as separate HTML and XML packages.</li>
        <li>To cut down on the number of "Why are these ports closed
rather
than stealthed?" questions, the SMB-related rules in
/etc/shorewall/common.def have been changed from 'reject' to
'DROP'.</li>
        <li>For easier identification, packets logged under the
'norfc1918'
interface option are now logged out of chains named 'rfc1918'.
Previously, such packets were logged under chains named
'logdrop'.</li>
        <li>Distributors and developers seem to be regularly inventing
new
naming conventions for kernel modules. To avoid the need to change
Shorewall code for each new convention, the MODULE_SUFFIX option
has been added to shorewall.conf. MODULE_SUFFIX may be set to the
suffix for module names in your particular distribution. If
MODULE_SUFFIX is not set in shorewall.conf, Shorewall will use the
list "o gz ko o.gz".<br>
          <br>
To see what suffix is used by your distribution:<br>
          <br>
ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter<br>
          <br>
All of the files listed should have the same suffix (extension).
Set MODULE_SUFFIX to that suffix.<br>
          <br>
Examples:<br>
          <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all files end in ".kzo" then set
MODULE_SUFFIX="kzo"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all files end in ".kz.o" then set
MODULE_SUFFIX="kz.o"</li>
        <li>Support for user defined rule ACTIONS has been implemented
through two new files:<br>
          <br>
/etc/shorewall/actions - used to list the user-defined ACTIONS.<br>
/etc/shorewall/action.template - For each user defined
&lt;action&gt;, copy this file to
/etc/shorewall/action.&lt;action&gt; and add the appropriate rules
for that &lt;action&gt;. Once an &lt;action&gt; has been defined,
it may be used like any of the builtin ACTIONS (ACCEPT, DROP, etc.)
in /etc/shorewall/rules.<br>
          <br>
Example: You want an action that logs a packet at the 'info' level
and accepts the connection.<br>
          <br>
In /etc/shorewall/actions, you would add:<br>
          <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LogAndAccept<br>
          <br>
You would then copy /etc/shorewall/action.template to
/etc/shorewall/LogAndAccept and in that file, you would add the two
rules:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOG:info<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACCEPT</li>
        <li>The default value for NEWNOTSYN in shorewall.conf is now
"Yes" (non-syn
TCP packets that are not part of an existing connection are filtered
according to the rules and policies rather than being dropped). I have
made this change for two reasons:<br>
          <br>
a) NEWNOTSYN=No tends to result in lots of "stuck" connections since
any timeout during TCP session tear down results in the firewall
dropping all of the retries.<br>
          <br>
b) The old default of NEWNOTSYN=No and LOGNEWNOTSYN=info resulted in
lots of confusing messages when a connection got "stuck". While I could
have changed the default value of LOGNEWNOTSYN to suppress logging, I
dislike defaults that silently throw away packets.</li>

Effective today, I am reducing my participation in the day-to-day
support of Shorewall. As part of this shift to community-based
Shorewall support a new <a
 href="https://lists.shorewall.net/mailman/listinfo/shorewall-newbies">Shorewall
Newbies mailing list</a> has been established to field questions
and problems from new users. I will not monitor that list
personally. I will continue my active development of Shorewall and
will be available via the development list to handle development
issues -- Tom.
