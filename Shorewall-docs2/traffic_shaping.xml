    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Starting with Version 2.5.5, Shorewall has builtin support for
    traffic shaping and control. Before this version, the support was quite
    limited. You were able to use your own tcstart script (and you still are),
    but besides the tcrules file it was not possible to define classes or
    queueing discplines inside the Shorewall config files.</para>

    <para>The support for traffic shaping and control still does not cover all
    options available (and especially all algorithms that can be used to queue
    traffic) for the Linux kernel but it should fit most needs. If you are
    using your own script for traffic control and you still want to use it
    rather the builtin support in the future, you will find information on how
    to do this, <link linkend="owntcstart">later in this document</link>. But
    for this to work, you will also need to enable traffic shaping in the
    kernel and Shorewall as covered by the next sections.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Linux traffic shaping and control</title>

    <para>This section gives a brief introduction of how controlling traffic
    with the linux kernel works. Although this might be enough for configuring
    it in the Shorewall configuration files, it still might be a good idea to
    take a deeper look into the <ulink url="http://ds9a.nl/lartc">Linux
    Advanced Routing and Shaping HOWTO</ulink>. At the time of writing this,
    the current version is 1.0.0.</para>

    <para>Since kernel 2.2 Linux has extensive support for controlling
    traffic. You can define different algorithms that are used to queue the
    traffic before it leaves an interface. The standard one is called pfifo
    and is (as the name suggests) of the type First In First out. This means,
    that it does not shape anything, if you have a connection that eats up all
    your bandwidth, this qeueing algorithm will not stop it from doing
    so.</para>

    <para>For Shorewall traffic shaping we use two algorithms, one is called
    HTB (Hierarchical Token Bucket) and SFQ (Stochastic Fairness Queuing). SFQ
    is easy to explain: it just tries to track your connections (tcp or udp
    streams) and balances the traffic between them. This normaly works ok. HTB
    allows you to define a set of classes, and you can put the traffic you
    want into these classes. You can define minimum and maximum bandwitdh
    settings for those classes and order the hierachically (the less priorized
    classes only get bandwitdth if the more important have what they need).
    Shorewall builtin traffic shaping allows you to define these classes (and
    their bandwidth limits), and it uses SFW inside these classes to make
    sure, that different data streams are handled equally.</para>

    <para>You can only shape outgoing traffic. The reason for this is simple,
    the packets were already received by your network card before you can
    decide what to do with them. So the only choice would be to drop them
    which does normally makes no sense (since you received the packet already,
    it went through the possible bottleneck (the incoming connection). The
    next possible bottleneck might come if the packet leaves on another
    interface, so this will be the place where queuing might occur. So,
    defining queues for incoming packages is not very useful, you just want to
    have it forwarded to the outgoing interface as fast as possible.</para>

    <para>There is one exception, though. Limiting incoming traffic to a value
    a bit slower than your actual line speed will avoid queuing on the other
    end of that connection. This is mostly useful if you don't have access to
    traffic control on the other side and if this other side has a faster
    network connection than you do (the line speed between the systems is the
    bottleneck, e.g. a DSL connection to you providers router). So, if you
    drop packages that are coming in too fast, the underlaying protocol might
    recognize this and slow down the connection. TCP has a builtin mechanism
    for this, UDP has not (but the protocol over UDP might recognize it , if
    there is any).</para>

    <para>The reason why qeueing is bad in these cases is, that you might have
    packets which need to be priorized over others, e.g. VoIP or ssh. For this
    type of connections it is important that packets arrive in a certain
    amount of time. For others like http downloads, it does not really matter
    if it takes a few seconds more.</para>

    <para>If you have a large queue on the other side and the router there
    does not care about QoS or the QoS bits are not set properly, your
    important packets will go into the same queue as your less timecritical
    download packets which will result in a large delay.</para>

    <title>Linux Kernel Configuration</title>

    <para>You will need at least kernel 2.4.18 for this to work, please take a
    look at the following screenshot for what settings you need to enable. For
    builtin support, you need the HTB scheduler, the PRIO pseudoscheduler and
    SFQ queue. The other scheduler or queue algorithms are not needed.</para>

    <title>Enable TC support in Shorewall</title>

    <para>You need this support whether you use the builtin support or whether
    you provide your own tcstart script.</para>

    <para>To enable the builtin traffic shaping and control in Shorewall, you
    have to do the following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Set <emphasis role="bold">TC_ENABLED</emphasis> to No in
        /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf. While that seems a bit illogical, it is
        done for compatibility with previous releases where TC_ENABLED=Yes
        causes Shorewall to look for an external tcstart file (See <link
        linkend="tcstart">a later section</link> for details).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Setting <emphasis role="bold">CLEAR_TC</emphasis> parameter in
        /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf to Yes will clear the traffic shaping
        configuration during Shorewall [re]start and Shorewall stop. This is
        normally what you want when using the builtin support (and also if you
        use your own tcstart script)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The other steps that follow depend on whether you use your own
        script or the builtin solution. They will be explained in the
        following sections.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Using builtin traffic shaping/control</title>

    <para>For defining bandwidths (for either devices or classes) please use
    kbit or kbps(for Kilobytes per second) and make sure there is NO space
    between the number and the unit (100kbit not 100 kbit). You generally
    could use mbit or mbps or just Bytes, but i suggest to use kbit, as values
    lether than 1 are not supported (NO 0.5mbit).</para>

    <para>To properly configure the settings for your devices you might need
    to find out, the real up- and downstream rates you have. This is
    especially the case, if you are using a DSL connection or one of another
    type that do not have a guaranteed bandwidth. There are several online
    tools that help you find out, try ..... Don't trust the values your
    provider tells you for this, especially measuring the real download speed
    is important!</para>

    <section>
      <title>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</title>

      <para>The fwmark classifier provides a convenient way to classify
      packets for traffic shaping. The /etc/shorewall/tcrules file provides a
      means for specifying these marks in a tabular fashion.</para>

      <para>Normally, packet marking occurs in the PREROUTING chain before any
      address rewriting takes place. This makes it impossible to mark inbound
      packets based on their destination address when SNAT or Masquerading are
      being used. You can cause packet marking to occur in the FORWARD chain
      by using the MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN option in shorewall.conf.</para>

      <para>Columns in the file are as follows:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>MARK - Specifies the mark value is to be assigned in case of a
          match. This is an integer in the range 1-255. This value may be
          optionally followed by <quote>:</quote> and either <quote>F</quote>
          or <quote>P</quote> to designate that the marking will occur in the
          FORWARD or PREROUTING chains respectively. If this additional
          specification is omitted, the chain used to mark packets will be
          determined by the setting of the MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN option in
          shorewall.conf.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>SOURCE - The source of the packet. If the packet originates on
          the firewall, place <quote>fw</quote> in this column. Otherwise,
          this is a comma-separated list of interface names, IP addresses, MAC
          addresses in Shorewall Format and/or Subnets.</para>

          interpreted as the destination icmp type(s).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>CLIENT PORT(S) - (Optional) Port(s) used by the client. If
          omitted, any source port is acceptable. Specified as a
          comma-separate list of port names, port numbers or port
          ranges.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>USER (Added in Shorewall version 1.4.10) - (Optional) This
          column may only be non-empty if the SOURCE is the firewall itself.

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>IN-BANDWIDTH - The incoming Bandwidth of that interface.
          Please note that you are not able to do traffic shaping on incoming
          traffic, as the traffic is already received before you could do so.
          This Column allows you to define the maximum traffic allowed for
          this interface in total, if the rate is exceeded, the packets are
          dropped. You want this mainly if you have a DSL or Cable Connection
          to avoid queuing at your providers side. If you don't want any
          traffic to be dropped set this to a value faster than your interface
          maximum rate.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>OUT-BANDWIDTH - Specifiy the outgoing bandwidth of that
          interface. This is the maximum speed your connection can handle. It
          is also the speed you can refer as "full" if you define the tc
          classes. Outgoing traffic above this rate will be dropped.</para>

          You define these marks in the tcrules file, marking the traffic you
          want to go into the queueing classes defined in here. You can use
          the same marks for different Interfaces.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>RATE - The minimum bandwidth this class should get, when the
          traffic load rises. Please note that first the classes which equal
          or a lesser priority value are served even if there are others that
          have a guaranteed bandwith but a lower priority.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>CEIL - The maximum bandwidth this class is allowed to use when
          the link is idle. Useful if you have traffic which can get full
          speed when more important services (e.g. interactive like ssh) are
          not used. You can use the value "full" in here for setting the

        <listitem>
          <para>PRIORITY - you have to define a priority for the class.
          packets in a class with a higher priority (=lesser value) are
          handled before less priorized onces. You can just define the mark
          value here also, if you are increasing the mark values with lesser
          priority.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>tos-&lt;tosname&gt; - this lets you define a filter for
              the given &lt;tosname&gt; which lets you define a value of the
              Type Of Service bits in the ip package which causes the package
              to go in this class. Please note, that this filter overrides all
              mark settings, so if you define a tos filter for a class all
              traffic having that mark will go in it regardless of the mark on
              the package. You can use the following for this option:
              tos-minimize-delay (16) tos-maximize-throughput (8)

              <para>tcp-ack - if defined causes an tc filter to be created
              that puts all tcp ack packets on that interface that have an
              size of &lt;=64 Bytes to go in this class. This is useful for
              speeding up downloads. Please note that the size of the ack
              packages is limited to 64 bytes as some applications (p2p for
              example) use to make every package an ack package which would
              cause them all into here. We want only packages WITHOUT payload
              to match, so the size limit. Bigger packets just take their
              normal way into the classes.</para>

        <para>Wondershaper allows you to define a set of hosts and/or ports
        you want to classify as low priority. To achieve this , you have to
        add these hosts to tcrules and set the mark to 3 (true if you use the
        example configuration files).</para>

        <para>Setting hosts to low priority</para>

        <para>lets assume the following settings from you old wondershaper
        script (don't assume these example values are really useful, they are
        only used for demonstrating):</para>

        <programlisting>
# low priority OUTGOING traffic - you can leave this blank if you want
# low priority source netmasks
NOPRIOHOSTSRC="192.168.1.128/25 192.168.3.28"

# low priority destination netmasks
NOPRIOHOSTDST=60.0.0.0/24

# low priority source ports
NOPRIOPORTSRC="6662 6663"

# low priority destination ports
NOPRIOPORTDST="6662 6663"

        <para>This would result in the following additional settings to the
