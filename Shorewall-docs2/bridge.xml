  <section>
    <title>Background</title>

    <para>Systems where Shorewall runs normally function as
    <firstterm>routers</firstterm>. In the context of the Open System
    Interconnect (OSI) reference model, a router operates at layer 3.
    Beginning with Shorewall version 2.0.1, Shorewall may also be deployed on
    a GNU Linux System that acts as a <firstterm>bridge</firstterm>. Bridges
    are layer-2 devices in the OSI model (think of a bridge as an ethernet
    switch).</para>

    <para>Some differences between routers and bridges are:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Routers determine packet destination based on the destination IP
        address while bridges route traffic based on the destination MAC
        address in the ethernet frame.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>As a consequence of the first difference, routers can be
        connected to more than one IP network while a bridge may be part of
        only a single network.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A router cannot forward broadcast packets while a bridge can.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Requirements</title>

    <para>In order to use Shorewall with a bridging firewall, your kernel must
    meet the following requirements:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>It must contain bridge support (CONFIG_BRIDGE=m or
        CONFIG_BRIDGE=y).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It must contain Netfilter physdev match support
        (CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_PHYSDEV=m or CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_PHYSDEV=y).
        Physdev match is available in the 2.6 kernel series but must be
        patched into the 2.4 kernels (see <ulink url="http://bridge.sf.net">http://bridge.sf.net</ulink>).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Your iptables must contain physdev match support. iptables 1.2.9
        and later contain this support.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You must have the bridge utilities (bridge-utils) package
        installed.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>You must also be running Shorewall 2.0.1 or later (users running
    Shorewall 2.0.0-RC* or Shorewall-2.0.0 may find the necessary updated
    files at <ulink url="http://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/Bridging">http://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/Bridging</ulink>).</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Application</title>

    <para>The following diagram shows a typical application of a
    bridge/firewall. There is already an existing router in place whose
    internal interface supports a network and you want to insert a firewall
    between the router and the systems in the local network. In the example
    shown, the network uses RFC 1918 addresses but that is not a requirement;
    the bridge would work exactly the same if public IP addresses were used
    (remember that the bridge doesn&#39;t deal with IP addresses).</para>

    <graphic fileref="images/bridge.png" />

    <para>There are a several key differences in this setup and a normal
    Shorewall configuration:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Shorewall system (the Bridge/Firewall) has only a single IP
        address even though it has two ethernet interfaces! The IP address is
        configured on the bridge itself rather than on either of the network
        cards.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The systems connected to the LAN are configured with the
        router&#39;s IP address (192.168.1.254 in the above diagram) as their
        default gateway.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><command>traceroute</command> doesn&#39;t detect the
        Bridge/Firewall as an intermediate router.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the router runs a DHCP server, the hosts connected to the LAN
        can use that server without having <command>dhcrelay</command> running
        on the Bridge/Firewall.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>There are other possibilities here -- there could be a hub or switch
    between the router and the Bridge/Firewall and there could be other
    systems connected to that switch. All of the systems on the local side of
    the router would still be configured with IP addresses in 192.168.1.0/24.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring the Bridge</title>

    <para>Configuring the bridge itself is quite simple and used the
    <command>brctl</command> utility from the bridge-utils package. Bridge
    configuration information may be found at <ulink
    url="http://bridge.sf.net">http://bridge.sf.net</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Unfortunately, Linux distributions don&#39;t have good bridge
    configuration tools and the network configuration GUIs don&#39;t detect
    the presence of bridge devices. You may refer to <ulink
    url="http://shorewall.net/2.0/myfiles.htm">my configuration files</ulink>
    for an example of configuring a bridge at system boot under
    <trademark>SuSE</trademark>. Here is an excerpt from a Debian
    <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> file for a bridge:</para>

    <programlisting>auto br0
iface br0 inet static
        address 192.168.1.253
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.1.0
        broadcast 192.168.1.255
        pre-up /sbin/ip link set eth0 up
        pre-up /sbin/ip link set eth1 up
        pre-up /usr/sbin/brctl addbr br0
        pre-up /usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 eth0
        pre-up /usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 eth1
gateway:/etc/network#</programlisting>

    <para>While it is not a requirement to give the bridge an IP address,
    doing so allows the bridge/firewall to access other systems and allows the
    bridge/firewall to be managed remotely. I have not tested Shorewall with a
    bridge configured without an IP address so if you try it and it
    doesn&#39;t work do not be surprised.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring Shorewall</title>

    <para>Bridging in Shorewall is enabled using the BRIDGING option in
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>BRIDGING=Yes</programlisting>

    <para>In the scenario pictured above, there would probably be two zones
    defined -- one for the internet and one for the local LAN so in
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/zones</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE   DISPLAY         COMMENTS
net     Net             Internet
loc     Local           Local networks
#LAST LINE - ADD YOUR ENTRIES ABOVE THIS ONE - DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>A conventional two-zone policy file is appropriate here —
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/policy</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#SOURCE     DEST        POLICY        LOG       LIMIT:BURST
loc         net         ACCEPT
net         all         DROP          info
all         all         REJECT        info
#LAST LINE - ADD YOUR ENTRIES ABOVE THIS ONE - DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>Only the bridge device itself is configured with an IP address so
    only that device is defined to Shorewall in <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE    INTERFACE      BROADCAST       OPTIONS
-       br0             192.168.1.255
#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>The zones are defined using the <filename>/etc/shorewall/hosts</filename>
    file. Assuming that the router is connected to <filename
    class="devicefile">eth0</filename> and the switch to <filename
    class="devicefile">eth1</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE           HOST(S)                         OPTIONS
net             br0:eth0
loc             br0:eth1
#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS LINE -- DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>When Shorewall is stopped, you want to allow only local traffic
    through the bridge — <filename><filename>/etc/shorewall/routestopped</filename></filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#INTERFACE      HOST(S)         OPTIONS
br0             192.168.1.0/24  routeback
#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename> file from the
    two-interface sample is a good place to start for defining a set of
    firewall rules.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Combination Router/Bridge</title>

    <para>A system running Shorewall doesn&#39;t have to be exclusively a
    bridge or a router -- it can act as both. Here&#39;s an example:<graphic
    fileref="images/bridge2.png" /></para>

    <para>This is basically the same setup as shown in the <ulink
    url="shorewall_setup_guide.htm">Shorewall Setup Guide</ulink> with the
    exception that the DMZ is bridged rather than using Proxy ARP. Changes in
    the configuration shown in the Setup Guide are as follows:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/proxyarp</filename> file is empty
        in this confiiguration.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename> file is as
        follows:<programlisting>#ZONE    INTERFACE      BROADCAST     OPTIONS
-        br0            detect        rfc1918,routefilter
loc      eth1           detect</programlisting></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/hosts</filename> file would have:</para>

        <programlisting>#ZONE    HOSTS                        OPTIONS
net      br0:eth0
dmz      br0:eth2</programlisting>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
