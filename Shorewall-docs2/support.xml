        <para>The three currently-supported Shorewall <ulink

        Because of the short time between the releases of 2.2.0 and 2.4.0,
        Shorewall 2.2 will be supported until 1 December 2006 or until the
        release of 3.1.0, whichever comes first.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Shorewall versions earlier than 2.2.0 are no longer supported;

        <para>If your problem is that an <emphasis

        <quote><command>shorewall start</command></quote> or if Shorewall is
        otherwise failing to start properly, then please:</para>

        <blockquote>

      <listitem>
        <para>If you are unsure if Shorewall is starting successfully or not

        <para>Please remember we only know what is posted in your message. Do
        not leave out any information that appears to be correct, or was
        mentioned in a previous post. There have been countless posts by
        people who were sure that some part of their configuration was correct
        when it actually contained a small error. We tend to be skeptics where
        detail is lacking.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Please keep in mind that you're asking for <emphasis
        role="bold">free</emphasis> technical support. Any help we offer is an
        act of generosity, not an obligation. Try to make it easy for us to
        help you. Follow good, courteous practices in writing and formatting
        your e-mail. Provide details that we need if you expect good answers.
        Exact quoting of error messages, log entries, command output, and
        other output is better than a paraphrase or summary.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Please give details about what doesn't work. Reports that say
        <quote>I followed the directions and it didn't work</quote> will
        elicit sympathy but probably little in the way of help. Again -- if
        ping from A to B fails, say so (and see below for information about
        reporting <quote>ping</quote> problems). If Computer B doesn't show up
        in <quote>Network Neighborhood</quote> then say so. If access by IP
        address works but by DNS names it doesn't then say so.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Please don't describe your environment and then ask us to send

        useful.</para>

        <para>As a general matter, <emphasis role="bold">please do not edit
        the diagnostic information</emphasis> in an attempt to conceal your IP
        address, netmask, nameserver addresses, domain name, etc. These aren't
        secrets, and concealing them often misleads us (and 80% of the time, a
        hacker could derive them anyway from information contained in the SMTP
        headers of your post).</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Do you see any <quote>Shorewall</quote> messages

        <para>Please include any of the Shorewall configuration files
        (especially the /etc/shorewall/hosts file if you have modified that
        file) that you think are relevant. If you include

    <title>When using the mailing list, please post in plain text</title>

    <para>A growing number of MTAs serving list subscribers are rejecting all
    HTML traffic. At least one MTA has gone so far as to blacklist
    shorewall.net <quote>for continuous abuse</quote> because it has been my
    policy to allow HTML in list posts!!</para>

    <para>I think that blocking all HTML is a Draconian way to control spam
    and that the ultimate losers here are not the spammers but the list
    subscribers whose MTAs are bouncing all shorewall.net mail. As one list
    subscriber wrote to me privately <quote>These e-mail admin's need to get a
    (expletive deleted) life instead of trying to rid the planet of HTML based
    e-mail</quote>. Nevertheless, to allow subscribers to receive list posts
    as must as possible, I have now configured the list server at
    shorewall.net to convert all HTML to plain text. Sometimes the conversion
    process fails in which case, the post sent to the list is empty. Even when
    conversion succeeds, the converted post is difficult to read so all of us
    will appreciate it if you just post in plain text to begin with.</para>
