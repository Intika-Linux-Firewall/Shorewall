# Shorewall version 2.2 - Rules File
#
# /etc/shorewall/rules
#
#	Rules in this file govern connection establishment. Requests and
#	responses are automatically allowed using connection tracking. For any
#       particular (source,dest) pair of zones, the rules are evaluated in the
#       order in which they appear in this file and the first match is the one
#       that determines the disposition of the request.
#
#	In most places where an IP address or subnet is allowed, you
#	can preceed the address/subnet with "!" (e.g., !192.168.1.0/24) to
#	indicate that the rule matches all addresses except the address/subnet
#	given. Notice that no white space is permitted between "!" and the
#	address/subnet.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: If you masquerade or use SNAT from a local system to the internet, 
#          you cannot use an ACCEPT rule to allow traffic from the internet to
#	   that system. You *must* use a DNAT rule instead.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Columns are:
#
#	ACTION		ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, DNAT, DNAT-, REDIRECT, CONTINUE,
#			LOG, QUEUE or an <action>.
#
#				ACCEPT   -- allow the connection request
#				ACCEPT+  -- like ACCEPT but also excludes the
#					    connection from any subsequent
#					    DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-] rules
#				NONAT    -- Excludes the connection from any
#					    subsequent DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-]
#					    rules but doesn't generate a rule
#					    to accept the traffic.
#				DROP     -- ignore the request
#				REJECT   -- disallow the request and return an
#					    icmp-unreachable or an RST packet.
#				DNAT     -- Forward the request to another
#					    system (and optionally another
#					    port).
#				DNAT-    -- Advanced users only.
#					    Like DNAT but only generates the
#					    DNAT iptables rule and not
#					    the companion ACCEPT rule.
#				REDIRECT -- Redirect the request to a local
#					    port on the firewall.
#				REDIRECT-
#					 -- Advanced users only.
#					    Like REDIRET but only generates the
#					    REDIRECT iptables rule and not
#					    the companion ACCEPT rule.
#
#				CONTINUE -- (For experts only). Do not process
#					    any of the following rules for this
#					    (source zone,destination zone). If
#					    The source and/or destination IP
#					    address falls into a zone defined
#					    later in /etc/shorewall/zones, this
#					    connection request will be passed
#					    to the rules defined for that
#					    (those) zone(s).
#				LOG      -- Simply log the packet and continue.
#				QUEUE	 -- Queue the packet to a user-space
#					    application such as ftwall
#					    (http://p2pwall.sf.net).
#				<action> -- The name of an action defined in
#					    /etc/shorewall/actions or in 
#					    /usr/share/shorewall/actions.std.
#
#			The ACTION may optionally be followed
#			by ":" and a syslog log level (e.g, REJECT:info or
#			DNAT:debug). This causes the packet to be
#			logged at the specified level.
#
#			If the ACTION names an action defined in
#			/etc/shorewall/actions or in
#			/usr/share/shorewall/actions.std then:
#
#			- If the log level is followed by "!' then all rules
#			  in the action are logged at the log level.
#
#			- If the log level is not followed by "!" then only
#			  those rules in the action that do not specify 
#			  logging are logged at the specified level.
#
#			- The special log level 'none!' suppresses logging
#			  by the action.
#
#			You may also specify ULOG (must be in upper case) as a
#			log level.This will log to the ULOG target for routing
#			to a separate log through use of ulogd
#			(http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd).
#
#			Actions specifying logging may be followed by a
#			log tag (a string of alphanumeric characters)
#			are appended to the string generated by the
#			LOGPREFIX (in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf). 
#
#			Example: ACCEPT:info:ftp would include 'ftp '
#			at the end of the log prefix generated by the
#			LOGPREFIX setting.
#
#	SOURCE		Source hosts to which the rule applies. May be a zone
#                       defined in /etc/shorewall/zones, $FW to indicate the
#			firewall itself, or "all" If the ACTION is DNAT or
#			REDIRECT, sub-zones of the specified zone may be
#			excluded from the rule by following the zone name with
#			"!' and a comma-separated list of sub-zone names.
#
#			When "all" is used either in the SOURCE or DEST column
#			intra-zone traffic is not affected. You must add 
#			separate rules to handle that traffic.
#
#			Except when "all" is specified, clients may be further
#			restricted to a list of subnets and/or hosts by
#			appending ":" and a comma-separated list of subnets
#			and/or hosts. Hosts may be specified by IP or MAC
#			address; mac addresses must begin with "~" and must use
#			"-" as a separator.
#
#			Hosts may be specified as an IP address range using the
#			syntax <low address>-<high address>. This requires that
#			your kernel and iptables contain iprange match support.
#
#			dmz:192.168.2.2		Host 192.168.2.2 in the DMZ
#
#			net:155.186.235.0/24	Subnet 155.186.235.0/24 on the
#						Internet
#
#			loc:192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2
#						Hosts 192.168.1.1 and
#						192.168.1.2 in the local zone.
#			loc:~00-A0-C9-15-39-78  Host in the local zone with
#                                               MAC address 00:A0:C9:15:39:78.
#
#			net:192.0.2.11-192.0.2.17
#						Hosts 192.0.2.11-192.0.2.17 in
#						the net zone.
#
#			Alternatively, clients may be specified by interface
#			by appending ":" to the zone name followed by the
#			interface name. For example, loc:eth1 specifies a
#			client that communicates with the firewall system
#			through eth1. This may be optionally followed by
#			another colon (":") and an IP/MAC/subnet address
#			as described above (e.g., loc:eth1:192.168.1.5).
#
#	DEST		Location of Server. May be a zone defined in
#			/etc/shorewall/zones, $FW to indicate the firewall
#			itself or "all"
#
#			When "all" is used either in the SOURCE or DEST column
#			intra-zone traffic is not affected. You must add 
#			separate rules to handle that traffic.
#
#			Except when "all" is specified, the server may be
#			further restricted to a particular subnet, host or
#			interface by appending ":" and the subnet, host or
#			interface. See above.
#
#				Restrictions:
#
#				1. MAC addresses are not allowed.
#				2. In DNAT rules, only IP addresses are
#				   allowed; no FQDNs or subnet addresses
#				   are permitted.
#				3. You may not specify both an interface and
#				   an address.
#
#			Like in the SOURCE column, you may specify a range of
#			up to 256 IP addresses using the syntax
#			<first ip>-<last ip>. When the ACTION is DNAT or DNAT-,
#			the connections will be assigned to addresses in the
#			range in a round-robin fashion.
#
#			The port that the server is listening on may be
#			included and separated from the server's IP address by
#			":". If omitted, the firewall will not modifiy the
#			destination port. A destination port may only be
#			included if the ACTION is DNAT or REDIRECT.
#
#			Example: loc:192.168.1.3:3128 specifies a local
#			server at IP address 192.168.1.3 and listening on port
#			3128. The port number MUST be specified as an integer
#			and not as a name from /etc/services.
#
#			if the ACTION is REDIRECT, this column needs only to
#			contain the port number on the firewall that the
#			request should be redirected to.
#
#	PROTO		Protocol - Must be "tcp", "udp", "icmp", a number, or
#			"all".
#
#	DEST PORT(S)    Destination Ports. A comma-separated list of Port
#			names (from /etc/services), port numbers or port
#			ranges; if the protocol is "icmp", this column is
#			interpreted as the destination icmp-type(s).
#
#			A port range is expressed as <low port>:<high port>.
#
#			This column is ignored if PROTOCOL = all but must be
#			entered if any of the following ields are supplied.
#			In that case, it is suggested that this field contain
#			 "-"
#
#			If your kernel contains multi-port match support, then
#			only a single Netfilter rule will be generated if in
#			this list and the CLIENT PORT(S) list below:
#			1. There are 15 or less ports listed.
#			2. No port ranges are included.
#			Otherwise, a separate rule will be generated for each
#			port.
#
#	CLIENT PORT(S)	(Optional) Port(s) used by the client. If omitted,
#			any source port is acceptable. Specified as a comma-
#			separated list of port names, port numbers or port
#			ranges.
#
#			If you don't want to restrict client ports but need to
#			specify an ORIGINAL DEST in the next column, then place
#			"-" in this column.
#
#			If your kernel contains multi-port match support, then
#			only a single Netfilter rule will be generated if in
#			this list and the DEST PORT(S) list above:
#			1. There are 15 or less ports listed.
#			2. No port ranges are included.
#			Otherwise, a separate rule will be generated for each
#			port.
#
#	ORIGINAL DEST	(0ptional -- only allowed if ACTION is DNAT[-] or
#                       REDIRECT[-]) If included and different from the IP
#			address given in the SERVER column, this is an address
#			on some interface on the firewall and connections to
#			that address will be forwarded to the IP and port
#			specified in the DEST column.
#
#			A comma-separated list of addresses may also be used. 
#			This is usually most useful with the REDIRECT target 
#			where you want to redirect traffic destined for
#			particular set of hosts.
#
#			Finally, if the list of addresses begins with "!" then
#			the rule will be followed only if the original 
#			destination address in the connection request does not
#			match any of the addresses listed.
#
#	RATE LIMIT	You may rate-limit the rule by placing a value in 
#			this colume:
# 
#				<rate>/<interval>[:<burst>]
#
#			where <rate> is the number of connections per 
#			<interval> ("sec" or "min") and <burst> is the
#			largest burst permitted. If no <burst> is given,
#			a value of 5 is assumed. There may be no
#			no whitespace embedded in the specification.
#
#				Example: 10/sec:20
#
#	USER/GROUP	This column may only be non-empty if the SOURCE is
#			the firewall itself.
#			
#			The column may contain:
#
#			   [!][<user name or number>][:<group name or number>]
#
#			When this column is non-empty, the rule applies only
#			if the program generating the output is running under
#			the effective <user> and/or <group> specified (or is
#			NOT running under that id if "!" is given).
#
#			Examples:
#
#				joe	#program must be run by joe
#				:kids	#program must be run by a member of
#					#the 'kids' group
#				!:kids  #program must not be run by a member
#					#of the 'kids' group
