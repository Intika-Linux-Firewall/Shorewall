#	This file is used to define the hosts that are accessible when the
#	firewall is stopped or when it is in the process of being
#	[re]started.
#
# Columns are:
#
#	INTERFACE	- Interface through which host(s) communicate with
#			  the firewall
#	HOST(S)		- (Optional) Comma-separated list of IP/subnet
#			  addresses. If your kernel and iptables include
#			  iprange match support, IP address ranges are also
#			  allowed.
#
#			  If left empty or supplied as "-",
#			  0.0.0.0/0 is assumed.
#	OPTIONS		- (Optional) A comma-separated list of
#			  options. The currently-supported options are:
#
#			  routeback - Set up a rule to ACCEPT traffic from
#			  these hosts back to themselves.
#
#			  source - Allow traffic from these hosts to ANY
#			  destination. Without this option or the 'dest'
#			  option, only traffic from this host to other
#			  listed hosts (and the firewall) is allowed. If
#			  'source' is specified then 'routeback' is redundent.
#
#			  dest - Allow traffic to these hosts from ANY
#			  source. Without this option or the 'source'
#			  option, only traffic from this host to other
#			  listed hosts (and the firewall) is allowed. If
#			  'dest' is specified then 'routeback' is redundent.
#
#			  critical - Allow traffic between the firewall and
#			  these hosts throughout '[re]start', 'stop' and
#			  'clear'. Specifying 'critical' on one or more
#			  entries will cause your firewall to be "totally
#			  open" for a brief window during each of those
#			  operations.
#
#		NOTE:   The 'source' and 'dest' options work best when used
#			in conjunction with ADMINISABSENTMINDED=Yes in
#			/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf.
#
# Example:
#
#	INTERFACE	HOST(S)			OPTIONS
#	eth2		192.168.1.0/24
#	eth0		192.0.2.44
#	br0		-			routeback
#	eth3		-			source
