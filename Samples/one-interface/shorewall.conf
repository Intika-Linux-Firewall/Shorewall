# Set this to the name of the lock file expected by your init scripts. For
# RedHat, this should be /var/lock/subsys/firewall. On Debian, it
# should be /var/state/shorewall. If your init scripts don't use lock files,
# set -this to "".
#

SUBSYSLOCK=/var/lock/subsys/shorewall

# This is the directory where the firewall maintains state information while
# it is running
#

STATEDIR=/var/lib/firewall

#
# Set this to "yes" or "Yes" if you want to accept all connection requests
# that are related to already established connections. For example, you want
# to accept FTP data connections. If you say "no" here, then to accept
# these connections between particular zones or hosts, you must include
# explicit "related" rules in /etc/shorewall/rules.
#

ALLOWRELATED="yes"

#
# If your netfilter kernel modules are in a directory other than
# /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter then specify that
# directory in this variable. Example: MODULESDIR=/etc/modules.

MODULESDIR=""

#
# The next two variables can be used to control the amount of log output
# generated. LOGRATE is expressed as a number followed by an optional
# `/second',  `/minute', `/hour', or `/day' suffix and specifies the maximum
# rate at which a particular message will occur. LOGBURST determines the
# maximum initial burst size that will be logged. If set empty, the default
# value of 5 will be used.
#
# If BOTH variables are set empty then the rate of logging will not be
# rate-limited.
#

LOGRATE="10/hour"
LOGBURST=5

#
# Enable nat support.
#
# You probally want yes here. Only gateways not doing NAT in any form, like
# SNAT,DNAT masquerading, port forwading etc. should say "no" here.
#
NAT_ENABLED="No"

#
# Enable mangle support.
#
# If you say "no" here, Shorewall will ignore the /etc/shorewall/tos file
# and will not initialize the mangle table when starting or stopping
# your firewall.
#
MANGLE_ENABLED="Yes"

#
# Enable IP Forwarding
#
# If you say "On" or "on" here, IPV4 Packet Forwarding is enabled. If you
# say "Off" or "off", packet forwarding will be disabled. You would only want
# to disable packet forwarding if you are installing Shorewall on a
# standalone system or if you want all traffic through the Shorewall system
# to be handled by proxies.
#
# If you set this variable to "Keep" or "keep", Shorewall will neither
# enable nor disable packet forwarding.
#
IP_FORWARDING="Off"

#
# Automatically add IP Aliases
#
# If you say "Yes" or "yes" here, Shorewall will automatically add IP aliases
# for each NAT external address that you give in /etc/shorewall/nat. If you say
# "No" or "no", you must add these aliases youself.
#
ADD_IP_ALIASES="Yes"

#
# Automatically add SNAT Aliases
#
# If you say "Yes" or "yes" here, Shorewall will automatically add IP aliases
# for each SNAT external address that you give in /etc/shorewall/masq. If you say
# "No" or "no", you must add these aliases youself.
#
ADD_SNAT_ALIASES="No"

#
# Enable Traffic Shaping
#
# If you say "Yes" or "yes" here, Traffic Shaping is enabled in the firewall. If
# you say "No" or "no" then traffic shaping is not enabled. If you enable traffic
# shaping you must have iproute[2] installed (the "ip" and "tc" utilities) and
# you must enable packet mangling above.
#
TC_ENABLED="No"

#
# Blacklisting
#
# Set this variable to the action that you want to perform on packets from
# Blacklisted systems. Must be DROP or REJECT. If not set or set to empty,
# DROP is assumed.
#
BLACKLIST_DISPOSITION=DROP

#
# Blacklist Logging
#
# Set this variable to the syslogd level that you want blacklist packets logged
# (beward of DOS attacks resulting from such logging). If not set, no logging
# of blacklist packets occurs.
#
BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL=

#
# MSS Clamping
#
# Set this variable to "Yes" or "yes" if you want the TCP "Clamp MSS to PMTU"
# option. This option is most commonly required when your internet
# interface is some variant of PPP (PPTP or PPPoE). Your kernel must
#
# If left blank, or set to "No" or "no", the option is not enabled.
#
CLAMPMSS="No"

#
# Route Filtering
#
# Set this variable to "Yes" or "yes" if you want kernel route filtering on all
# interfaces.
#
ROUTE_FILTER="No"
