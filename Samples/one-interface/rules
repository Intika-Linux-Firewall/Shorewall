# 	Shorewall version 2.2 - Sample Rules File For One Interface
#
# 	/etc/shorewall/rules
#
#	Rules in this file govern connection establishment. Requests and
#	responses are automatically allowed using connection tracking.
#	For any particular (source,dest) pair of zones, the rules are evaluated
#	in the order in which they appear in this file and the first match is 
#	the one that determines the disposition of the request.
#
#	In most places where an IP address or subnet is allowed, you
#	can preceed the address/subnet with "!" (e.g., !192.168.1.0/24) to
#	indicate that the rule matches all addresses except the address/subnet
#	given. Notice that no white space is permitted between "!" and the
#	address/subnet.
#
#	WARNING:	If you masquerade or use SNAT from a local system to the internet
#			you cannot use a ACCEPT rule to allow traffic from the internet to
#			that system. You *must* use a DNAT rule instead.	
# Columns are:
#
#
#	ACTION			ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, DNAT, DNAT-, REDIRECT,
#				REDIRECT-, CONTINUE, LOG, QUEUE or an <action>.
#
#				ACCEPT
#						Allow the connection request
#				ACCEPT+
#						Like ACCEPT but also excludes the
#						connection from any subsequent
#						DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-] rules
#				NONAT
#						Excludes the connection from any
#						subsequent DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-]
#						rules but doesn't generate a rule
#						to accept the traffic.
#				DROP
#						Ignore the request
#				REJECT
#						Disallow the request and return an
#						icmp-unreachable or an RST packet.
#				DNAT
#						Forward the request to another
#						system (and optionally another
#						port).
#				DNAT-
#						Advanced users only.
#						Like DNAT but only generates the
#						DNAT iptables rule and not
#						the companion ACCEPT rule.
#				REDIRECT
#						Redirect the request to a local
#					    	port on the firewall.
#				REDIRECT-
#						Advanced users only.
#						Like REDIRECT but only generates the
#						REDIRECT iptables rule and not the
#						companion ACCEPT rule.
#				CONTINUE
#						(For experts only). Do Not Process
#						any of the following rules for this
#						(source zone,destination zone). If
#						the source and/or destination IP
#						address falls into a zone defined
#						later in /etc/shorewall/zones, this
#						connection request will be passed
#						to the rules defined for that
#						(those) zones(s).
#				LOG		
#						Simply log the packet and continue.
#				QUEUE     	
#						Queue the packet to a user-space
#						application such as ftwall.
#						(http://p2pwall.sf.net).
#				<action>
#						The name of an action defined in 
#						/etc/shorewall/actions or in 
#						/usr/share/shorewall/actions.std.
#
#			The ACTION may optionally be followed by ":" and a syslog
#			log level (e.g, REJECT:info or DNAT:debug). This causes the 
#			packet to be logged at the specified level.
#		
#			If the ACTION names an action defined in
#			/etc/shorewall/actions or in
#			/usr/share/shorewall/actions.std then:
#
#			- If the log level is followed by "!' then all rules
#			  in the action are logged at the log level.
#
#			- If the log level is not followed by "!" then only
#			  those rules in the action that do not specify
#			  logging are logged at the specified level.
#
#			- The special log level 'none!' suppresses logging
#			  by the action.
#
#			You may also specify ULOG (Must be in upper case) as a log
#			level. This will log to the ULOG target for routing to a
#			seperate log through the use of ulogd.
#			(http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd).						
#
#			Actions specifying logging may be followed by a
#			log tag (a string of alphanumeric characters)
#			are appended to the string generated by the
#			LOGPREFIX (in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf).
#
#			Example: ACCEPT:info:ftp would include 'ftp '
#			at the end of the log prefix generated by the
#			LOGPREFIX setting.
##
#	SOURCE		Source hosts to which the rule applies. May be a zone
#			defined in /etc/shorewall/zones, $FW to indicate the
#			firewall itself, or "all" If the ACTION is DNAT or
#			REDIRECT, sub-zones of the specified zone may be
#			excluded from the rule by following the zone name with
#			"!' and a comma-separated list of sub-zone names.
#
#			When "all" is used either in the SOURCE or DEST column
#			intra-zone traffic is not affected. You must add
#			separate rules to handle that traffic.
#
#			Except when "all" is specified, clients may be further
#			restricted to a list of subnets and/or hosts by
#			appending ":" and a comma-separated list of subnets
#			and/or hosts. Hosts may be specified by IP or MAC
#			address; mac addresses must begin with "~" and must use
#			"-" as a separator.
#
#		Some Examples:
#
#			net:155.186.235.1
#						Host 155.186.235.1 on the Internet
#
#			net:155.186.235.0/24
#						Subnet 155.186.235.0/24 on the
#						Internet
#
#			net:155.186.235.1,155.186.235.2
#						Hosts 155.186.235.1 and
#						155.186.235.2 on the Internet.
#
#			net:~00-A0-C9-15-39-78
#						Host on the Internet with
#						MAC address 00:A0:C9:15:39:78.
#
#			net:192.0.2.11-192.0.2.17
#						Hosts 192.0.2.11-192.0.2.17 in
#						the net zone.
#
#			Alternatively, clients may be specified by interface
#			by appending ":" to the zone name followed by the
#			interface name. For example, net:eth0 specifies a
#			client that communicates with the firewall system
#			through eth0. This may be optionally followed by
#			another colon (":") and an IP/MAC/subnet address
#			as described above (e.g., net:eth0:192.168.1.5).
#
#	DEST		Location of Server. May be a zone defined in
#			/etc/shorewall/zones, $FW to indicate the firewall
#			itself or "all"
#
#			When "all" is used either in the SOURCE or DEST column
#			intra-zone traffic is not affected. You must add
#			separate rules to handle that traffic.
#
#			Except when "all" is specified, the server may be
#			further restricted to a particular subnet, host or
#			interface by appending ":" and the subnet, host or
#			interface. See above.
#
#		Restrictions:
#
#			1.	MAC addresses are not allowed.
#			2. 	In DNAT rules, only IP addresses are
#				allowed; no FQDNs or subnet addresses
#				are permitted.
#			3.	You may not specify both an interface and
#				an address
#
#			Unlike in the SOURCE column, you may specify a range of
#			up to 256 IP addresses using the syntax
#			<first ip>-<last ip>. When the ACTION is DNAT or DNAT-,
#			the connections will be assigned to addresses in the
#			range in a round-robin fashion.
#
#			The port that the server is listening on may be
#			included and separated from the server's IP address by
#			":". If omitted, the firewall will not modifiy the
#			destination port. A destination port may only be
#			included if the ACTION is DNAT or REDIRECT.
#
#			Example: net:155.186.235.1:25 specifies a Internet
#			server at IP address 155.186.235.1 and listening on port
#			25. The port number MUST be specified as an integer
#			and not as a name from /etc/services.
#
#			If the ACTION is REDIRECT, this column needs only to
#			contain the port number on the firewall that the
#			request should be redirected to.
#
#	PROTO		Protocol - Must be "tcp", "udp", "icmp", "ipp2p",
#			a number, or "all". "ipp2p" requires ipp2p match
#			support in your kernel and iptables.
#
#	DEST PORT(S)	Destination Ports. A comma-separated list of Port
#			names (from /etc/services), port numbers or port
#			ranges; if the protocol is "icmp", this column is
#			interpreted as the destination icmp-type(s).
#
#			If the protocol is ipp2p, this column is interpreted
#			as an ipp2p option without the leading "--" (example "bit"
#			for bit-torrent). If no port is given, "ipp2p" is
#			assumed.
#
#			A port range is expressed as <low port>:<high port>.
#
#			This column is ignored if PROTOCOL = all but must be
#			entered if any of the following fields are supplied.
#			In that case, it is suggested that this field contain
#			 "-"
#
#			If your kernel contains multi-port match support, then
#			only a single Netfilter rule will be generated if in
#			this list and the CLIENT PORT(S) list below:
#			1. There are 15 or less ports listed.
#			2. No port ranges are included.
#			Otherwise, a separate rule will be generated for each
#			port.
#
#	CLIENT PORT(S)	(Optional) Port(s) used by the client. If omitted,
#			any source port is acceptable. Specified as a comma-
#			separated list of port names, port numbers or port
#			ranges.
#
#			If you don't want to restrict client ports but need to
#			specify an ORIGINAL DEST in the next column, then place
#			"-" in this column.
#
#			If your kernel contains multiport match support, then
#			only a single Netfilter rule will be generated if in
#			this list and the DEST PORT(S) list above:
#			1. There are 15 or less ports listed.
#			2. No port ranges are included.
#			Otherwise, a separate rule will be generated for each
#			port.
#
#	ORIGINAL DEST	(0ptional -- only allowed if ACTION is DNAT[-] or 
#			REDIRECT[-}) If included and different from the IP
#			address given in the SERVER column, this is an address
#			on some interface on the firewall and connections to
#			that address will be forwarded to the IP and port
#			specified in the DEST column.
#
#			A comma-separated list of addresses may also be used.
#			This is usually most useful with the REDIRECT target
#			where you want to redirect traffic destined for
#			a particular set of hosts.
#			
#			Finally, if the list of addresses begins with "!" then
#			the rule will be followed only if the original
#			destination address in the connection request does not
#			match any of the addresses listed.
#
#	RATE LIMIT	You may rate-limit the rule by placing a value in this column:
#
#				<rate>/<interval>[:<burst>]
#
#			Where <rate> is the number of connections per <interval> ("sec"
#			or "min") and <burst> is the largest burst permitted. If no
#			<burst> is given, a value of 5 is assummed. There may be no
#			whitespace embedded in the specification.
#
#		Example:
#				10/sec:20
#
#			If you place a rate limit in this column, you may not place
#			a similiar limit in the ACTION column.
#
#	USER/GROUP
#			This column may only be non-empty if the SOURCE is the firewall itself.
#
#			This column may contain:
#
#			[!][<user name or number>][:<group name or number>]
#
#			When this column is non-empty, the rule applies only if the program
#			generating the output is running under the effective <user> and/or
#			<group> specified (or is NOT running under that id if "!' is given).
#
#		Examples:
#			joe	# program must be run by joe
#			:kids	# program must be run by a member of the 'kids' group.
#			!:kids	# program must not be run by a member of the 'kids' group.
#
#	Note: Most one interface rules are of the type ACCEPT, REDIRECT or REJECT.
#	DNAT, DNAT-, CONTINUE rules are for multiple interface firewall.
#	Also by default all outbound fw -> net communications are allowed.
#	(One Interface Only) You can change this behavior in the sample policy file.
#
#	Example: Accept www requests to the one interface server.
#
#	#ACTION		SOURCE	DEST	PROTO	DEST	SOURCE	ORIGINAL	RATE	USER/
