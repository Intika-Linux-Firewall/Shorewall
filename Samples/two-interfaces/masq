# Shorewall 1.2 - Masquerade file
#
# /etc/shorewall/masq
#
# Use this file to define dynamic NAT (Masquerading)
#
# Columns are:
#
#	INTERFACE -- Outgoing interface. This is usually your internet
#		     interface. This may be qualified by adding the character
#                    ":" followed by a destination host or subnet.
#
#
#	SUBNET -- Subnet that you wish to masquerade. You can specify this as
#		  a subnet or as an interface. If you give the name of an
#		  interface, you must have iproute installed and the interface
#		  must be up before you start the firewall.
#
#	Example 1:
#
#		  You have a simple masquerading setup where eth0 connects to
#		  a DSL or cable modem and eth1 connects to your local network
#		  with subnet 192.168.0.0/24.
#
#		  Your entry in the file can be either:
#
#			eth0	eth1
#
#		  or
#
#			eth0	192.168.0.0/24
#
#	Example 2:
#
#		  You add a router to your local network to connect subnet
#		  192.168.1.0/24 which you also want to masquerade. You then
#		  add the following entry to this file:
#
#			eth0	192.168.1.0/24
#
#       Example 3:
#
#                 You have an IPSEC tunnel through ipsec0 and you want to
#                 masquerade packets coming from 192.168.1.0/24 but only if
#                 these packets are destined for hosts in 10.1.1.0/24:
#
#                       ipsec0:10.1.1.0/24      196.168.1.0/24
