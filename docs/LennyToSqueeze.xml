  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Debian Lenny includes Shorewall version 4.0.15 while Squeeze
    includes Shorewall 4.4. Because there are significant differences between
    the two product versions, some users may experience upgrade issues. This
    article outlines those issues and offers advice for dealing with
    them.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Although this article is targeted specifically at Lenny -&gt;
      Squeeze upgrades, it should be useful to any Shorewall-shell user
      upgrading to Shorewall 4.4.x. Footnotes are used to flag areas where
      non-Debian users may experience different results.</para>

  <section id="Packages">
    <title>Packaging Differences</title>

    <para>The first key difference between Shorewall 4.0 and Shorewall 4.4 is
    in the packaging<footnote>
        <para>Most distributions use a similar packaging structure. Note,
        however, that the 'shorewall' package in Simon Mater's RPMs for
        RedHat/Fedora/CentOS is like the Lenny shorewall-common
        package.</para>
      </footnote>. In Lenny, there are six Shorewall packages:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall-common — Contains the basic components needed to
        create an IPv4 firewall.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall-shell — The legacy Shorewall configuration compiler
        written in Bourne shell.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall — A transitional package that depends on
        shorewall-common and shorewall-shell. Installing this package installs
        both shorewall-common and shorewall-shell.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall-perl — A re-implementation of the Shorewall
        configuration compiler in Perl. This compiler has many advantages over
        the shell-based compiler:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The compiler is much faster</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The compiler does a much better job of validating the
            configuration, thus avoiding run-time errors.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The compiler produces better and more consistent diagnostic
            messages.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The compiler produces a script that runs much faster and
            that does not reject/drop connections during start/restart.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall-lite — A small package that can run scripts generated
        by shorewall-shell or shorewall-perl. Allows centralized firewall
        administration.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall-doc — Documentation.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>In Squeeze, there are six slightly different packages:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall — Contains everything needed to create an IPv4
        firewall. It combines the former shorewall-common and shorewall-perl
        packages.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall6 — Depends on shorewall. Adds those components needed
        to create an IPv6 firewall.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall-lite — Same as in Lenny; only runs IPv4 firewall
        scripts.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall6-lite — Similar to shorewall-lite, except that it only
        runs IPv6 firewall scripts.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall-init — Allows the firewall to be closed before
        interfaces are brought up and also allows the firewall to react to
        interfaces coming up and going down.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>shorewall-doc — Documentation.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <warning>
      <para>Do not purge the old packages (shorewall-common, shorewall-shell
      and shorewall-perl) until after the new shorewall package has been
      installed.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>The key change in Squeeze that may produce upgrade issues is that
    Squeeze does not include the shell-based configuration compiler. As a
    consequence, unless you are already using Shorewall-perl on Lenny, an
    upgrade from Lenny to Squeeze will mean that you will be switching from
    the old shell-based compiler to the new Perl-based compiler<footnote>
        <para>Note that Perl is a required package on Debian. If you are
        running an embedded distribution which does not include Perl and it is
        not feasible to install Perl on your firewall, then you should
        consider installing Shorewall on another system in your network (may
        be a <trademark>Windows</trademark> system running
        <trademark>Cygwin</trademark> or an <trademark>Apple</trademark>
        <trademark>MacIntosh</trademark> running OS X) and installing
        Shorewall-lite on your firewall.</para>
      </footnote>. While the two compilers are highly compatible, there are
    some differences. Those differences are detailed in the following
    sections.</para>

  <section id="Issues">
    <title>Issues Most Likely to Cause Problems or Concerns</title>

    <section id="conf">
      <title>shorewall.conf</title>

      <para>As always, when upgrading from one major release of Shorewall to
      another, the installer will prompt you about replacing your existing
      <filename>shorewall.conf</filename> with the updated one from the
      package. Shorewall is designed with the assumption that users will never
      replace shorewall.conf and retaining your existing file will always
      produce upward-compatible behavior.</para>

      <para>That having been said, there are a few settings that you may have
      in your shorewall.conf that will cause compilation warning or error
      messages after the upgrade.</para>

          <term>BLACKLISTNEWONLY</term>

            <para>To eliminate the error, reverse the setting of one of the
            options.</para>

            <note>
              <para>This combination never worked correctly in earlier
              versions -- to duplicate the earlier behavior, you will want to
              set BLACKLISTNEWONLY=Yes.</para>

      <para>You will need to add an entry for your firewall zone. The default

      <para>There is a long tradition of specifying an interface name in the
      SOURCE column of this file.</para>

      <para>Masquerading/SNAT occurs in the Netfilter POSTROUTING chain where
      an incoming interface may not be specified in iptables rules.
      Consequently, while processing the <command>shorewall start</command>
      and <command>shorewall restart</command> commands, the generated script
      must examine the firewall's main routing table to determine those
      networks that are routed out of the interface; the script then adds a
      MASQUERADE/SNAT rule for connections from each of those networks. This
      additional processing requires the named interface to be up and
      configured when Shorewall starts or restarts.</para>

      <para>Users often complain that Shorewall fails to start at boot time
      because a VPN interface that is named as a masq SOURCE isn't up and
      configured during boot.</para>

      <para>To emphasize this restriction, if an interface is named in the
      SOURCE column of one or more entries, a single warning is issued as
      follows:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">WARNING: Using an interface as the masq
        SOURCE requires the interface to be up and configured when Shorewall

      <para>The 'critical' option is no longer needed and hence is no longer

      <para>To suppress the warning, simply remove the option.</para>

      <para>Shorewall 4.4 also treats the <filename>routestopped</filename>
      file differently from earlier releases. Previously, the
      <filename>routestopped</filename> file was parsed during
      <command>shorewall stop</command> processing so that changes made to the
      file while Shorewall was running would be applied at the next
      <command>stop</command>. This is no longer the case -- the
      <filename>routestopped</filename> file is processed during compilation
      just like the rest of the configuration files so that when
      <command>shorewall stop</command> is issued, the firewall will pass
      traffic based on the contents of the <filename>routestopped</filename>
      file at the last <command>start</command> or
      <command>restart</command>.</para>

      <para>If you change the <filename>routestopped</filename> file and now
      want to stop the firewall, you can run this sequence of commands:</para>

    <section id="tos">

      <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/tos</filename> file now has
      zone-independent SOURCE and DEST columns as do all other files except
      the rules and policy files.</para>

      <para>The SOURCE column may be one of the following:</para>

      <simplelist>
        <member>[<command>all</command>:]&lt;<replaceable>address</replaceable>&gt;[,...]</member>

        <member><command>$FW</command>[:&lt;<replaceable>address</replaceable>&gt;[,...]]</member>

      <para>The DEST column may be one of the following:</para>

      <simplelist>
        <member>[<command>all</command>:]&lt;<replaceable>address</replaceable>&gt;[,...]</member>

        <member>[<command>all</command>:]&lt;<replaceable>interface</replaceable>&gt;[:&lt;<replaceable>address</replaceable>&gt;[,...]]</member>
      </simplelist>

      <para>This is a permanent change. The old zone-based rules have never
      worked right and this is a good time to replace them. We have tried to
      make the new syntax cover the most common cases without requiring change
      to existing files. In particular, it will handle the
      <filename>tos</filename> file released with Shorewall 1.4 and
      earlier.</para>

      <title>Extension Scripts</title>

      <para>With the shell-based compiler, all extension scripts were copied
      into the compiled script and executed at run-time. In some cases, this
      approach doesn't work with Shorewall Perl because (almost) the entire
      rule set is built by the compiler. As a result, Shorewall-perl runs some
      extension scripts at compile-time rather than at run-time. Because the
      compiler is written in Perl, these extension scripts from earlier
      versions will no longer work.</para>
