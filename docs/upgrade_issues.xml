    <title>Important</title>

    <para>It is important that you read all of the sections on this page where
    the version number mentioned in the section title is later than what you
    are currently running.</para>

    <para>In the descriptions that follows, the term
    <emphasis>group</emphasis> refers to a particular network or subnetwork
    (which may be <literal>0.0.0.0/0</literal> or it may be a host address)
    accessed through a particular interface.</para>

    <para>Examples:</para>

    <simplelist columns="1" type="vert">
      <member><literal>eth0:0.0.0.0/0</literal></member>

      <member><literal>eth2:192.168.1.0/24</literal></member>

      <member><literal>eth3:192.0.2.123</literal></member>
    </simplelist>

    <para>You can use the <command moreinfo="none">shorewall check</command>
    command to see the groups associated with each of your zones.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Version &gt;= 3.2.0</title>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If you are upgrading from version 2.4 or earlier, please read
        the 3.0.0 upgrade considerations below.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A number of macros have been split into two. The macros affected
        are:</para>

        <simplelist>
          <member>IMAP</member>

          <member>LDAP</member>

          <member>NNTP</member>

          <member>POP3</member>

          <member>SMTP</member>
        </simplelist>

        <para>Each of these macros now handles only traffic on the native
        (plaintext) port. There is a corresponding macro with S added to the
        end of the name for the SSL version of the same protocol. Thus each
        macro results in the insertion of only one port per invocation. The
        Web macro has not been split, but two new macros, HTTP and HTTPS have
        been created. The Web macro is deprecated in favour of these new
        macros, and may be removed from future Shorewall releases.</para>

        <para>These changes have been made to ensure no unexpected ports are
        opened due to the use of macros.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In previous Shorewall releases, DNAT and REDIRECT rules
        supported a special syntax for exclusion of a subnet from the effect
        of the rule.</para>

        <para>Example:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para>Z2 is a subzone of Z1:</para>

          <programlisting>DNAT     Z1!Z2        loc:192.168.1.4        ...</programlisting>
        </blockquote>

        <para>That feature has never worked correctly when Z2 is a dynamic
        zone. Furthermore, now that Shorewall supports exclusion lists, the
        capability is redundant since the above rule can now be written in the
        form:</para>

        <programlisting>DNAT     Z1:!&lt;list of exclusions&gt;   loc:192.168.1.4   ...</programlisting>

        <para>Beginning with Shorewall 3.2.0, the special exclusion syntax
        will no longer be supported.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Important if you use the QUEUE target.</para>

        <para>In the /etc/shorewall/rules file and in actions, you may now
        specify 'tcpsyn' in the PROTO column. 'tcpsyn' is equivalent to 'tcp'
        but also requires that the SYN flag is set and the RST, FIN and ACK
        flags be off ("--syn" is added to the iptables rule).</para>

        <para>As part of this change, Shorewall no longer adds the "--syn"
        option to TCP rules that specify QUEUE as their target.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Extension Scripts may require change</para>

        <para>In previous releases, extension scripts were executed during
        <command>[re]start</command> by using the Bourne Shell "." operator.
        In addition to executing commands during <command>[re]start</command>,
        these scripts had to "save" the commands to be executed during
        <command>shorewall restore</command>.</para>

        <para>This clumsiness has been eliminated in Shorewall 3.2. In
        Shorewall 3.2, extension scripts are copied in-line into the compiled
        program and are executed in-line during <command>start</command>,
        <command>restart</command> and <command>restore</command>.</para>

        <para>This new approach has two implications for existing
        scripts.</para>

        <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
          <listitem>
            <para>It is no longer necessary to save the commands; so functions
            like 'save_command', 'run_and_save_command' and
            'ensure_and_save_command' need no longer be called. The generated
            program will contain functions with these names:</para>

            <simplelist>
              <member>save_command() - does nothing</member>

              <member>run_and_save_command() - runs the passed
              command</member>

              <member>ensure_and_save_command() - runs the passed command and
              stops the firewall if the command fails.</member>
            </simplelist>

            <para>These functions should provide for transparent migration of
            scripts that use them until you can get around to eliminating
            their use completely.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>When the extension script is copied into the compiled
            program, it is indented to line up with the surrounding code. If
            you have 'awk' installed on your system, the Shorewall compiler
            will correctly handle line continuation (last character on the
            line = "\"). If you do not have awk, it will not be possible to
            use line-continuation in your extension scripts. In no case is it
            possible to continue a quoted string over multiple lines without
            having additional whitespace inserted into the string.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para> Beginning with this release, the way in which packet marking in
        the PREROUTING chain interracts with the 'track' option in
        /etc/shorewall/providers has changed in two ways:</para>

        <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
          <listitem>
            <para>Packets arriving on a tracked interface are now passed to
            the PREROUTING marking chain so that they may be marked with a
            mark other than the 'track' mark (the connection still retains the
            'track' mark).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>When HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes, you can still clear the mark on
            packets in the PREROUTING chain (i.e., you can specify a mark
            value of zero).</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para> Kernel version 2.6.16 introduces 'xtables', a new common packet
        filtering and connection tracking facility that supports both IPv4 and
        IPv6. Because a different set of kernel modules must be loaded for
        xtables, Shorewall now includes two 'modules' files:</para>

        <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
          <listitem>
            <para><filename>/usr/share/shorewall/modules</filename> -- the
            former <filename>/etc/shorewall/modules</filename></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>/usr/share/shorewall/xmodules -- a new file that support
            xtables.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>If you wish to use the new file, then simply execute this
        command:</para>

        <para><command>cp -f /usr/share/shorewall/xmodules
        /etc/shorewall/modules</command></para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version &gt;= 3.0.0</title>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The "monitor" command has been eliminated.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The "DISPLAY" and "COMMENTS" columns in the /etc/shorewall/zones
        file have been removed and have been replaced by the former columns of
        the /etc/shorewall/ipsec file. The latter file has been
        removed.</para>

        <para>Additionally the FW option in shorewall.conf has been deprecated
        and is no longer set to 'fw' by default. New users are expected to
        define the firewall zone in /etc/shorewall/zones.</para>

        <para>Adhering to the principle of least astonishment, the old
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/ipsec</filename> file will continue to be
        supported. A new IPSECFILE variable in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf
        determines the name of the file that Shorewall looks in for IPSEC
        information. If that variable is not set or is set to the empty value
        then IPSECFILE=ipsec is assumed. So if you simply upgrade and don't do
        something idiotic like replace your current shorewall.conf file with
        the new one, your old configuration will continue to work. A dummy
        'ipsec' file is included in the release so that your package manager
        (e.g., rpm) won't remove your existing file.</para>

        <para>The shorewall.conf file included in this release sets
        IPSECFILE=zones so that new users are expected to use the <ulink
        url="Documentation.htm#Zones">new zone file format</ulink>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The DROPINVALID option has been removed from shorewall.conf. The
        behavior will be as if DROPINVALID=No had been specified. If you wish
        to drop invalid state packets, use the dropInvalid built-in
        action.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The 'nobogons' interface and hosts option as well as the
        BOGON_LOG_LEVEL option have been eliminated.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Most of the standard actions have been replaced by parameterized
        macros (see below). So for example, the action.AllowSMTP and
        action.DropSMTP have been removed an a parameterized macro macro.SMTP
        has been added to replace them.</para>

        <para>In order that current users don't have to immediately update
        their rules and user-defined actions, Shorewall can substitute an
        invocation of the a new macro for an existing invocation of one of the
        old actions. So if your rules file calls AllowSMTP, Shorewall will
        replace that call with SMTP/ACCEPT. Because this substitution is
        expensive, it is conditional based on the setting of MAPOLDACTIONS in
        shorewall.conf. If this option is set to YES or if it is not set (such
        as if you are using your old shorewall.conf file) then Shorewall will
        perform the substitution. Once you have converted to use the new
        macros, you can set MAPOLDACTIONS=No and invocations of those actions
        will go much quicker during 'shorewall [re]start'.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The STATEDIR variable in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf has been
        removed. STATEDIR is now fixed at /var/lib/shorewall. If you have
        previously set STATEDIR to another directory, please copy the files
        from that directory to /var/lib/shorewall/ before [re]starting
        Shorewall after the upgrade to this version.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The "shorewall status" command now just gives the status of
        Shorewall (started or not-started). The previous status command has
        been renamed "dump". The command also shows the state relative to the
        state diagram at <ulink
        url="http://shorewall.net/starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm">http://shorewall.net/starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm</ulink>.
        In addition to the state, the time and date at which that state was
        entered is shown.</para>

        <para>Note that at least one "shorewall [re]start" must be issued
        after upgrading to this release before "shorewall status" will show
        anything but "Unknown" for the state.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The "shorewall forget" command now removes the dynamic blacklist
        save file (/var/lib/shorewall/save).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In previous versions of Shorewall, the rules generated by
        entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/tunnels</filename> preceded those
        rules generated by entries in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename>. Beginning with this
        release, the rules generated by entries in the tunnels file will
        appear *AFTER* the rules generated by the rules file. This may cause
        you problems if you have REJECT, DENY or CONTINUE rules in your rules
        file that would cause the tunnel transport packets to not reach the
        rules that ACCEPT them. See <ulink
        url="http://www.shorewall.net/VPNBasics.html">http://www.shorewall.net/VPNBasics.html</ulink>
        for information on the rules generated by entries in the tunnels
        file.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The NEWNOTSYN and LOGNEWNOTSYN options in shorewall.conf have
        been removed as have the 'newnotsyn' options in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename> and
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/hosts</filename>.</para>

        <para>TCP new-not-syn packets may be blocked using the 'dropNotSyn' or
        'rejNotSyn' built-in actions.</para>

        <para>Example: Reject all new-not-syn packets from the net and log
        them at the 'info' level.</para>

        the rules file.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A new TC_SCRIPT option replaces TC_ENABLED in shorewall.conf. If
        the option is not set then the internal shaper (tc4shorewall by Arne
        Bernin) is used. Otherwise, the script named in the variable is
        used.</para>

        <para>Users who currently use an
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcstart</filename> file and wish to continue

        contains entries for only those three address ranges reserved by RFC
        1918. A 'nobogons' interface option has been added which handles bogon
        source addresses (those which are reserved by the IANA, those reserved
        for DHCP auto-configuration and the class C test-net reserved for
        testing and documentation examples). This will allow users to perform
        RFC 1918 filtering without having to deal with out of date data from
        IANA. Those who are willing to update their
        <filename>/usr/share/shorewall/bogons</filename> file regularly can
        specify the 'nobogons' option in addition to 'norfc1918'. The level at
