      <listitem>
        <para>Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.2, using /etc/shorewall-lite/vardir
        and /etc/shorewall6-lite/vardir to specify VARDIR is deprecated in
        favor of the VARDIR setting in shorewallrc.</para>

        <para>NOTE: While the name of the variable remains VARDIR, the meaning
        is slightly different. When set in shorewallrc, each product
        (shorewall-lite, and shorewall6-lite) will create a directory under
        the specified path name to hold state information.</para>

        <para>Example:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para>VARDIR=/opt/var/</para>

          <para>The state directory for shorewall-lite will be
          /opt/var/shorewall-lite/ and the directory for shorewall6-lite will
          be /opt/var/shorewall6-lite.</para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>When VARDIR is set in /etc/shorewall[6]/vardir, the product will
        save its state directly in the specified directory.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Begining with Shorewall 4.5.6, the tcrules file is processed if
        MANGLE_ENABLED=Yes, independent of the setting of TC_ENABLED. This
        allows actions like TTL and TPROXY to be used without enabling traffic
        shaping. If you have rules in your tcrules file that you only want
        processed when TC_ENABLED is other than 'No', then enclose them
        in</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para>?IF $TC_ENABLED</para>

          <para>...</para>

          <para>?ENDIF</para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>If they are to be processed only if TC_ENABLED=Internal, then
        enclose them in</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para>?IF TC_ENABLED eq 'Internal'</para>

          <para>...</para>

          <para>?ENDIF.</para>
        </blockquote>

        <para/>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.7, the deprecated
        /etc/shorewall[6]/blacklist files are no longer installed. Existing
        files are still processed by the compiler.</para>

        <para>Note that blacklist files may be converted to equivalent blrules
        files using <command>shorewall[6] update -b</command>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In Shorewall 4.5.7, the
        <filename>/etc/shorewall[6]/notrack</filename> file was renamed
        <filename>/etc/shorewall[6]/conntrack</filename>. When upgrading to a
        release &gt;= 4.5.7, the <filename>conntrack</filename> file will be
        installed along side of an existing <filename>notrack</filename>
        file.</para>

        <para>If the 'notrack' file is non-empty, a warning message is issued
        during compilation:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para>WARNING: Non-empty notrack file (...); please move its
          contents to the conntrack file</para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>This warning can be eliminated by removing the notrack file (if
        it has no entries), or by moving its entries to the conntrack file and
        removing the notrack file. Note that the conntrack file is always
        populated with rules</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In Shorewall 4.5.8, the /etc/shorewall[6]/routestopped files
        were deprecated if favor of new /etc/shorewall[6]/stoppedrules
        counterparts. The new files have much more familiar and
        straightforward semantics. Once a stoppedrules file is populated, the
        compiler will process that file and will ignore the corresponding
        routestopped file.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In Shorewall 4.5.8, a new variable (VARLIB) was added to the
        shorewallrc file. This variable assumes the role formerly played by
        VARDIR, and VARDIR now designates the configuration directory for a
        particular product.</para>

        <para>This change should be transparent to all users:</para>

        <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
          <listitem>
            <para>If VARDIR is set in an existing shorewallrc file and VARLIB
            is not, then VARLIB is set to ${VARDIR} and VARDIR is set to
            ${VARLIB}/${PRODUCT}.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>If VARLIB is set in a shorewallrc file and VARDIR is not,
            then VARDIR is set to ${VARLIB}/${PRODUCT}.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>The Shorewall-core installer will automatically update
        ~/.shorewallrc and save the original in ~/.shorewallrc.bak.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Previously, the macro.SNMP macro opened both UDP ports 161 and
        162 from SOURCE to DEST. This is against the usual practice of opening
        these ports in the opposite direction. Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.8,
        the SNMP macro opens port 161 from SOURCE to DEST as before, and a new
        SNMPTrap macro is added that opens port 162 (from SOURCE to
        DEST).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.11, ?FORMAT is preferred over
        FORMAT for specifying the format of records in these configuration
        files:</para>

        <para>The first instance of 'FORMAT' (without the '?') will generate

          <member>WARNING: FORMAT is deprecated in favor of ?FORMAT; consider
          running 'shorewall update -D'</member>

        <para>As the warning suggests, 'shorewall[6] update -D' will convert
        all instances of FORMAT to ?FORMAT in files on the CONFIG_PATH.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Also beginning with Shorewalll 4.5.11, ?COMMENT is preferred

      <listitem>
        <para>To allow finer-grained selection of the connection-tracking
        states that are passed through blacklists (both dynamic and static), a

        Shorewall 4.5.13.</para>

        <para>The BLACKLISTNEWONLY option was deprecated at that point. A

      <listitem>
        <para>In Shorewall 4.5.14, the BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL option was renamed
        BLACKLIST_LOG_LEVEL to be consistent with the other log-level option

        BLACKLIST_LOG_LEVEL, but a 'shorewall update' or 'shorewall6 update'

        <para>Previously, Shorewall has treated traffic shaping class IDs as
        decimal numbers (or pairs of decimal numbers). That worked fine until
        IPMARK was implemented. IPMARK requires Shorewall to generate class
        Ids in numeric sequence. In 4.3.9, that didn't work correctly because
        Shorewall was generating the sequence "..8,9,10,11..." when the
        correct sequence was "...8,9,a,b,...". Shorewall now treats class IDs
        as hex, like 'tc' and 'iptables' do.</para>

        release, Shorewall will attempt to undo these changes. This change can
        present a migration issue in that the initial routing configuration
        when this version of Shorewall is installed has probably been changed

      <listitem>
        <para>A number of macros have been split into two. The macros affected
        are:</para>

        <simplelist>
          <member>IMAP</member>

          <member>LDAP</member>

          <member>NNTP</member>

          <member>POP3</member>

          <member>SMTP</member>
        </simplelist>

        <para>Each of these macros now handles only traffic on the native
        (plaintext) port. There is a corresponding macro with S added to the
        end of the name for the SSL version of the same protocol. Thus each
        macro results in the insertion of only one port per invocation. The
        Web macro has not been split, but two new macros, HTTP and HTTPS have
        been created. The Web macro is deprecated in favour of these new
        macros, and may be removed from future Shorewall releases.</para>

        <para>These changes have been made to ensure no unexpected ports are
        opened due to the use of macros.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In previous Shorewall releases, DNAT and REDIRECT rules
        supported a special syntax for exclusion of a subnet from the effect
        of the rule.</para>

        <para>Example:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para>Z2 is a subzone of Z1:</para>

          <programlisting>DNAT     Z1!Z2        loc:192.168.1.4        ...</programlisting>
        </blockquote>

        <para>That feature has never worked correctly when Z2 is a dynamic
        zone. Furthermore, now that Shorewall supports exclusion lists, the
        capability is redundant since the above rule can now be written in the
        form:</para>

        <programlisting>DNAT     Z1:!&lt;list of exclusions&gt;   loc:192.168.1.4   ...</programlisting>

        <para>Beginning with Shorewall 3.2.0, the special exclusion syntax
        will no longer be supported.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Important if you use the QUEUE target.</para>

        <para>In the /etc/shorewall/rules file and in actions, you may now
        specify 'tcp:syn' in the PROTO column. 'tcp:syn' is equivalent to
        'tcp' but also requires that the SYN flag is set and the RST, FIN and
        ACK flags be off ("--syn" is added to the iptables rule).</para>

        <para>As part of this change, Shorewall no longer adds the "--syn"
        option to TCP rules that specify QUEUE as their target.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Extension Scripts may require change</para>

        <para>In previous releases, extension scripts were executed during
        <command>[re]start</command> by using the Bourne Shell "." operator.
        In addition to executing commands during <command>[re]start</command>,
        these scripts had to "save" the commands to be executed during
        <command>shorewall restore</command>.</para>

        <para>This clumsiness has been eliminated in Shorewall 3.2. In
        Shorewall 3.2, extension scripts are copied in-line into the compiled
        program and are executed in-line during <command>start</command>,
        <command>restart</command> and <command>restore</command>. This
        applies to all extension scripts except those associated with a chain
        or action -- those extension scripts continue to be processed at
        compile time.</para>

        <para>This new approach has two implications for existing
        scripts.</para>

        <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
          <listitem>
            <para>It is no longer necessary to save the commands; so functions
            like 'save_command', 'run_and_save_command' and
            'ensure_and_save_command' need no longer be called. The generated
            program will contain functions with these names:</para>

            <simplelist>
              <member>save_command() - does nothing</member>

              <member>run_and_save_command() - runs the passed

              <member>ensure_and_save_command() - runs the passed command and
              stops the firewall if the command fails.</member>
            </simplelist>

            <para>These functions should provide for transparent migration of
            scripts that use them until you can get around to eliminating

          <listitem>
            <para>When the extension script is copied into the compiled

            will correctly handle line continuation (last character on the
            line = "\"). If you do not have awk, it will not be possible to
            use line-continuation in your extension scripts. In no case is it
            possible to continue a quoted string over multiple lines without
            having additional whitespace inserted into the string.</para>

        Previously, CLASSIFY tcrules were always processed out of the
        POSTROUTING chain. Beginning with this release, they are processed out
        of the POSTROUTING chain *except* when the SOURCE is
        $FW[:&lt;address&gt;] in which case the rule is processed out of the
        OUTPUT chain.</para>

        <para>With correctly-coded rulesets, this change should have no
        effect. Users having incorrectly-coded tcrules may need to change
        them.</para>

        <para>Example:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <programlisting>#MARK/          SOURCE  DEST    PROTO   DEST            SOURCE
#CLASSIFY                               PORTS(S)        PORT(S)
1:110           $FW     eth3    tcp     -               22</programlisting>
        </blockquote>

        <para>While the user may have expected this rule to only affect
        traffic from the firewall itself, the rule was really equivalent to
        this one:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <programlisting>#MARK/    SOURCE        DEST    PROTO   DEST            SOURCE
#CLASSIFY                               PORTS(S)        PORT(S)
1:110     0.0.0.0/0     eth3    tcp     -               22</programlisting>
        </blockquote>

        <para>So after this change, the second rule will be required rather
        than the first if that is what was really wanted.</para>

        <para>Adhering to the principle of least astonishment, the old

        determines the name of the file that Shorewall looks in for IPSEC
        information. If that variable is not set or is set to the empty value
        then IPSECFILE=ipsec is assumed. So if you simply upgrade and don't do
        something idiotic like replace your current shorewall.conf file with
        the new one, your old configuration will continue to work. A dummy
        'ipsec' file is included in the release so that your package manager
        (e.g., rpm) won't remove your existing file.</para>

        <para>In order that current users don't have to immediately update
        their rules and user-defined actions, Shorewall can substitute an
        invocation of the a new macro for an existing invocation of one of the
        old actions. So if your rules file calls AllowSMTP, Shorewall will
        replace that call with SMTP(ACCEPT). Because this substitution is
        expensive, it is conditional based on the setting of MAPOLDACTIONS in
        shorewall.conf. If this option is set to YES or if it is not set (such
        as if you are using your old shorewall.conf file) then Shorewall will
        perform the substitution. Once you have converted to use the new
        macros, you can set MAPOLDACTIONS=No and invocations of those actions
        will go much quicker during 'shorewall [re]start'.</para>
