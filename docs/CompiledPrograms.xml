    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall version 3.1, Shorewall has the capability
    to compile a Shorewall configuration and produce a runnable firewall
    program script. The script is a complete program which can be placed in
    the /etc/init.d/ directory on a system without Shorewall installed and can
    serve as the firewall creation script for that system.</para>

    <para>Compiled programs can also be created to instantiate special
    configurations during parts of the day; for example, to disallow web
    browsing between the hours of 9pm and 7AM. The program can be run as a
    cron job at 9PM and another program run at 6AM to restore normal
    operation.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Restrictions</title>

      <para>While compiled Shorewall programs are useful in many cases, there
      are some important restrictions that you should be aware of before
      attempting to use them.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The <emphasis role="bold">detectnets</emphasis> interface
          option is not supported.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>DYNAMIC_ZONES=Yes in <filename>shorewall.conf</filename> is
          not supported.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All extension scripts used are copied into the program. The
          ramifications of this are:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If you update an extension script, the compiled program
              will not use the updated script.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> extension
              script is executed at compile time as well as at run
              time.</para>

              <para>Running the script at compile time allows variable
              expansion (expanding $variable to it's defined value) of
              variables used in Shorewall configuration files to occur at
              compile time. Running it at run-time allows your extension
              scripts to use the variables that it creates. BUT -- for any
              given variable, the value at compile time may be different from
              the value at run-time unless you only assign constant
              values.</para>

              <para>For example, if you have:</para>

              <programlisting>EXT_IP=$(fiind_first_interface_address eth0)</programlisting>

              <para>in <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> then all
              occurrences of $EXT_IP in Shorewall configuration files will be
              replaced with eth0's IP address when the program is being
              compiled. On the other hand, if you use $EXT_IP in your
              /etc/shorewall/start script, the value will be the IP address of
              eth0 when the program is run.</para>

              <para>Bottom line: You probably want to use only constant values
              for variables set in
              <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename>.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must install Shorewall Lite on the system where you want
          to run the script. You then install the compiled program in
          /usr/share/shorewall/firewall and use the /sbin/shorewall program
          included with Shorewall Lite to control the firewall just as if the
          full Shorewall distribution was installed.</para>

    <title>The "shorewall compile" command</title>

    <para>A compiled script is produced using the <command>compile</command>
    command:</para>

            <para>Indicates that the program is to be "exported" to another
            system. When this flag is set, the "detectnets" interface is not
            allowed but the created program may be run on a system that has
            only Shorewall Lite installed</para>

            <para>When this flag is given, Shorewall does not probe the
            current system to determine the kernel/iptables features that it
            supports. It rather reads those capabilities from
            <filename>/etc/shorewall/capabilities</filename>. See below for

    <para>As you can see, the file contains a simple list of shell variable

    <command>shorewall show capabilities</command> command appear in the same
    order as the output of that command.</para>

    <para>To aid in creating this file, Shorewall Lite includes a
    <command>shorecap</command> program. The program is installed in the
    <filename>/usr/share/shorewall/</filename> directory and may be run as
    follows:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><command>[ IPTABLES=&lt;iptables binary&gt; ] [
      MODULESDIR=&lt;kernel modules directory&gt; ]
      /usr/share/shorewall/shorecap &gt; capabilities</command></para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The IPTABLES and MODULESDIR options have their <ulink
    url="Documentation.htm#Conf">usual Shorewall default
    values</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The <filename>capabilities</filename> file may then be copied to a
    system with Shorewall installed and used when compiling firewall programs
    to run on the remote system.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Running compiled programs directly</title>

    <para>Compiled firewall programs are complete programs that support the
    following run-line commands:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <simplelist>
        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        version</command></member>
      </simplelist>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The options have their same meaning is when they are passed to
    <filename>/sbin/shorewall</filename> itself. The default VERBOSITY level
    is the level specified in the shorewall.conf file used when then program
    was compiled.</para>
