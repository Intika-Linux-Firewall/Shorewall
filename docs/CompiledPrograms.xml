  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall version 3.1, Shorewall has the capability
    to compile a Shorewall configuration and produce a runnable firewall
    program script. The script is a complete program which can be placed in
    the /etc/init.d/ directory on a system without Shorewall installed and can
    serve as the firewall creation script for that system.</para>

    <para>Compiled programs can also be created to instantiate special
    configurations during parts of the day; for example, to disallow web
    browsing between the hours of 9pm and 7AM. The program can be run as a
    cron job at 9PM and another program run at 6AM to restore normal
    operation.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Restrictions</title>

      <para>While compiled Shorewall programs are useful in many cases, there
      are some important restrictions that you should be aware of before
      attempting to use them.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The <emphasis role="bold">detectnets</emphasis> interface
          option is not supported.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All extension scripts used are copied into the program. The
          ramifications of this are:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If you update an extension script, the compiled program
              will not use the updated script.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> extension
              script is executed at compile time as well as at run
              time.</para>

              <para>Running the script at compile time allows variable
              expansion (expanding $variable to it's defined value) of
              variables used in Shorewall configuration files to occur at
              compile time. Running it at run-time allows your extension
              scripts to use the variables that it creates. BUT -- for any
              given variable, the value at compile time may be different from
              the value at run-time unless you only assign constant
              values.</para>

              <para>For example, if you have:</para>

              <programlisting>EXT_IP=$(fiind_first_interface_address eth0)</programlisting>

              <para>in <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> then all
              occurrences of $EXT_IP in Shorewall configuration files will be
              replaced with eth0's IP address when the program is being
              compiled. On the other hand, if you use $EXT_IP in your
              /etc/shorewall/start script, the value will be the IP address of
              eth0 when the program is run.</para>

              <para>Bottom line: You probably want to use only constant values
              for variables set in
              <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>The "shorewall compile" command</title>

    <para>A compiled script is produced using the <command>compile</command>
    command:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><command>shorewall compile [ -e ] [ -d &lt;distro&gt; ] [
      &lt;directory name&gt; ] &lt;path name&gt;</command></para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>where</para>

    <blockquote>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>-e</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Indicates that the program is to be "exported" to another
            system. When this flag is set, the "detectnets" interface is not
            allowed but the created program may be run on a system that
            doesn't even have Shorewall installed.</para>

            <para>When this flag is given, Shorewall does not probe the
            current system to determine the kernel/iptables features that it
            supports. It rather reads those capabilities from
            <filename>/etc/shorewall/capabilities</filename>. See below for
            details.</para>
          </listitem>

          <term>-d &lt;distro&gt;</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>is normally used with "-e" and specifies the Linux
            distribution that is running on the remote system. The program
            will be tailored so that it integrates with the initialization
            script system (init) on that system. Distributions currently
            supported are:</para>

              <member>redhat</member>

              installed directly into <filename
              class="directory">/etc/init.d</filename> â€” they require the
              soon-to-be-released Shorewall-minimal Debian package.</member>
            </simplelist>

            <para>If <emphasis role="bold">-d</emphasis> is not specified, the
            compiled program is generally not suitable for being installed in
            <filename class="directory">/etc/init.d</filename>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>The /etc/shorewall/capabilities file and the shorecap
    program</title>

    <para>As mentioned above, the /etc/shorewall/capabilities file specifies
    that kernel/iptables capabilities of the target system. Here is a sample
    file:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <programlisting>NAT_ENABLED=Yes                 # NAT
MANGLE_ENABLED=Yes              # Packet Mangling
CONNTRACK_MATCH=Yes             # Connection Tracking Match
USEPKTTYPE=                     # Packet Type Match
MULTIPORT=Yes                   # Multi-port Match
XMULTIPORT=Yes                  # Extended Multi-port Match
POLICY_MATCH=Yes                # Policy Match
PHYSDEV_MATCH=Yes               # Physdev Match
LENGTH_MATCH=Yes                # Packet Length Match
IPRANGE_MATCH=Yes               # IP range Match
RECENT_MATCH=Yes                # Recent Match
OWNER_MATCH=Yes                 # Owner match
IPSET_MATCH=                    # Ipset Match
CONNMARK=Yes                    # CONNMARK Target
CONNMARK_MATCH=Yes              # Connmark Match
RAW_TABLE=Yes                   # Raw Table
IPP2P_MATCH=                    # IPP2P Match
CLASSIFY_TARGET=Yes             # CLASSIFY Target
ENHANCED_REJECT=Yes             # Extended REJECT</programlisting>
    </blockquote>

    <para>As you can see, the file contains a simple list of shell variable
    assignments -- the variables correspond to the capabilities listed by the
    <command>shorewall show capabilities</command> command appear in the same
    order as the output of that command.</para>

    <para>To aid in creating this file, Shorewall 3.1 and later include a
    shorecap program. The program is installed in the documentation directory
    by the .rpm and is in the directory created when you untar the tarball. It
    may be copied to /usr/bin on a remote system then run as follows:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><command>[ IPTABLES=&lt;iptables binary&gt; ] [
      MODULESDIR=&lt;kernel modules directory&gt; ] shorecap &gt;
      capabilities</command></para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The IPTABLES and MODULESDIR options have their <ulink
    url="Documentation.htm#Conf">usual Shorewall default
    values</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The <filename>capabilities</filename> file may then be copied to a
    system with Shorewall installed and used when compiling firewall programs
    to run on the remote system.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Running compiled programs</title>

    <para>Compiled firewall programs are complete programs that support the
    following run-line commands:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <simplelist>
        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        start</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        stop</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        clear</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        restart</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        status</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        version</command></member>
      </simplelist>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The options have their same meaning is when they are passed to
    <filename>/sbin/shorewall</filename> itself. The default VERBOSITY level
    is the level specified in the shorewall.conf file used when then program
    was compiled.</para>
