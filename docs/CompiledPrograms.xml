    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall version 3.1, Shorewall has the capability
    to compile a Shorewall configuration and produce a runnable firewall
    program script. The script is a complete program which can be placed on a
    system with <emphasis>Shorewall Lite</emphasis> installed and can serve as
    the firewall creation script for that system.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Restrictions</title>

      <para>While compiled Shorewall programs are useful in many cases, there
      are some important restrictions that you should be aware of before
      attempting to use them.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The <emphasis role="bold">detectnets</emphasis> interface
          option is not supported.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>DYNAMIC_ZONES=Yes in <filename>shorewall.conf</filename> is
          not supported.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All extension scripts used are copied into the program. The
          ramifications of this are:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If you update an extension script, the compiled program
              will not use the updated script.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> extension
              script is executed at compile time as well as at run
              time.</para>

              <para>Running the script at compile time allows variable
              expansion (expanding $variable to it's defined value) of
              variables used in Shorewall configuration files to occur at
              compile time. Running it at run-time allows your extension
              scripts to use the variables that it creates. BUT -- for any
              given variable, the value at compile time may be different from
              the value at run-time unless you only assign constant
              values.</para>

              <para>For example, if you have:</para>

              <programlisting>EXT_IP=$(find_first_interface_address eth0)</programlisting>

              <para>in <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> then all
              occurrences of $EXT_IP in Shorewall configuration files will be
              replaced with eth0's IP address when the program is being
              compiled. On the other hand, if you use $EXT_IP in your
              /etc/shorewall/start script, the value will be the IP address of
              eth0 when the program is run.</para>

              <para>Bottom line: You probably want to use only constant values
              for variables set in
              <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename>.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must install Shorewall Lite on the system where you want
          to run the script. You then install the compiled program in
          /usr/share/shorewall/firewall and use the /sbin/shorewall program
          included with Shorewall Lite to control the firewall just as if the
          full Shorewall distribution was installed.</para>

    <title>The "shorewall compile" command</title>

    <para>A compiled script is produced using the <command>compile</command>
    command:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><command>shorewall compile [ -e ] [ &lt;directory name&gt; ]

          <listitem>
            <para>Indicates that the program is to be "exported" to another
            system. When this flag is set, neither the "detectnets" interface
            option nor DYNAMIC_ZONES=Yes in shorewall.conf are allowed. The
            created program may be run on a system that has only Shorewall
            Lite installed</para>

            <para>When this flag is given, Shorewall does not probe the
            current system to determine the kernel/iptables features that it
            supports. It rather reads those capabilities from
            <filename>/etc/shorewall/capabilities</filename>. See below for
            details.</para>

            SHOREWALL_SHELL and VERBOSITY settings from
            <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename> are used and
            these apply only to the compiler itself. The settings used by the
            compiled firewall script are determined by the contents of
            <filename>&lt;directory name&gt;/shorewall.conf</filename>.</para>

    <title>Shorewall Lite (Added in version 3.2.0 RC 1)</title>

    <important>
      <para>The following information applies to <emphasis

      of Shorewall and Shorewall Lite earlier than 3.2.2 are urged to
      upgrade.</para>
    </important>

    <para>Shorewall Lite is a companion product to Shorewall and is designed
    to allow you to maintain all Shorewall configuration information on a
    single system within your network.</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
      <listitem>
        <para>You install the full Shorewall release on one system within your
        network. You need not configure Shorewall there and you may totally

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>On each system where you wish to run a Shorewall-generated
        firewall, you install Shorewall Lite. For ease of reference, we will
        call these systems the 'firewall systems'.</para>

        <note>
          <para>The firewall systems do <emphasis role="bold">NOT</emphasis>
          need to have the full Shorewall product installed but rather only
          the Shorewall Lite product. Shorewall and Shorewall LIte may be

            <para>It is important to understand that with Shorewall Lite, the
            firewall's export directory on the administrative system acts as
            <filename class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename> for that
            firewall. So when the Shorewall documentation gives instructions
            for placing entries in files in the firewall's <filename
            class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename>, when using Shorewall
            Lite you make those changes in the firewall's export directory on
            the administrative system.</para>

            <para>The CONFIG_PATH variable is treated as follows:</para>

    <para>There is a <filename>shorewall.conf</filename> file installed as

    <para>As you can see, the file contains a simple list of shell variable
    assignments -- the variables correspond to the capabilities listed by the
    <command>shorewall show capabilities</command> command and they appear in
    the same order as the output of that command.</para>

    <para>To aid in creating this file, Shorewall Lite includes a
    <command>shorecap</command> program. The program is installed in the
    <filename>/usr/share/shorewall-lite/</filename> directory and may be run
    as follows:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><command>[ IPTABLES=&lt;iptables binary&gt; ] [
      MODULESDIR=&lt;kernel modules directory&gt; ]
      /usr/share/shorewall-lite/shorecap &gt; capabilities</command></para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The IPTABLES and MODULESDIR options have their <ulink
    url="Documentation.htm#Conf">usual Shorewall default
    values</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The <filename>capabilities</filename> file may then be copied to a
    system with Shorewall installed and used when compiling firewall programs
    to run on the remote system.</para>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall Lite version 3.2.2, the capabilities file
    may also be creating using
    <filename>/sbin/shorewall-lite:</filename><blockquote>
        <para><command>shorewall-lite show -f capabilities &gt;
        capabilities</command></para>
      </blockquote></para>

    <title>Running compiled programs directly</title>

    <para>Compiled firewall programs are complete programs that support the
    following run-line commands:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <simplelist>
        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        start</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        stop</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        clear</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        reset</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        restart</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        status</command></member>

        <member><command>&lt;program&gt; [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -n ]
        version</command></member>
      </simplelist>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The options have their same meaning is when they are passed to
    <filename>/sbin/shorewall</filename> itself. The default VERBOSITY level
    is the level specified in the shorewall.conf file used when then program
    was compiled.</para>
