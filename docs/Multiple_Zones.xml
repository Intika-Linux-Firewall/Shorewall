    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>While most configurations can be handled with each of the firewall's
    network interfaces assigned to a single zone, there are cases where you
    will want to divide the hosts accessed through an interface between two or
    more zones.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The interface has multiple addresses on multiple subnetworks.
        This case is covered in the <ulink
        url="Shorewall_and_Aliased_Interfaces.html">Aliased Interface
        documentation</ulink>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You are using some form of NAT and want to access a server by
        its external IP address from the same LAN segment. This is covered in
        <ulink url="FAQ.htm#faq2">FAQs 2 and 2a</ulink>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>There are routers accessible through the interface and you want
        to treat the networks accessed through that router as a separate
        zone.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Some of the hosts accessed through an interface have
        significantly different firewalling requirements from the others so
        you want to assign them to a different zone.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The key points to keep in mind when setting up multiple zones per
    interface are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Shorewall generates rules for zones in the order that the zone
        declarations appear in /etc/shorewall/zones unless you modify the
        processing order using the explicit
        <emphasis>child-zone</emphasis>:<emphasis>parent-zone</emphasis>
        syntax, in which case the child zone rules are generated first.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The order of entries in /etc/shorewall/hosts is immaterial as
        far as the generated rule set is concerned.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">These examples use the local zone but the same
    technique works for any zone.</emphasis> Remember that Shorewall doesn't
    have any conceptual knowledge of <quote>Internet</quote>,
    <quote>Local</quote>, or <quote>DMZ</quote> so all zones except the
    firewall itself ($FW) are the same as far as Shorewall is concerned. Also,
    the examples use private (RFC 1918) addresses but public IP addresses can
    be used in exactly the same way.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="Router">
    <title>Router in the Local Zone</title>

    <para>Here is an example of a router in the local zone.</para>

    <note>
      <para>the <emphasis role="bold">box called <quote>Router</quote> could
      be a VPN server</emphasis> or other such device; from the point of view
      of this discussion, it makes no difference.</para>

      <title>Can You Use the Standard Configuration?</title>

      <para>In many cases, the <ulink url="two-interface.htm">standard
      two-interface Shorewall setup</ulink> will work fine in this
      configuration. It will work if:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The firewall requirements to/from the Internet are the same
          for 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The hosts in 192.168.1.0/24 know that the route to
          192.168.2.0/24 is through the <emphasis
          role="bold">router</emphasis>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>All you have to do on the firewall is add a route to
      192.168.2.0/24 through the <emphasis role="bold">router</emphasis> and
      restart Shorewall.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="Enough">
      <title>Will One Zone be Enough?</title>

      <para>If the firewalling requirements for the two local networks is the
      same but the hosts in 192.168.1.0/24 don't know how to route to
      192.168.2.0/24 then you need to configure the firewall slightly
      differently. This type of configuration is rather stupid from an IP
      networking point of view but it is sometimes necessary because you
      simply don't want to have to reconfigure all of the hosts in
      192.168.1.0/24 to add a persistent route to 192.168.2.0/24. On the
      firewall:</para>

    <section id="Separate">
      <title>I Need Separate Zones</title>

      <para>If you need to make 192.168.2.0/24 into its own zone, you can do
      it one of two ways; Nested Zones or Parallel Zones.</para>

      <section id="Nested">
        <title>Nested Zones</title>

        <para>You can define one zone (called it <quote>loc</quote>) as being
        all hosts connected to eth1 and a second zone <quote>loc1</quote>
        (192.168.2.0/24) as a sub-zone.</para>

        <graphic fileref="images/MultiZone1A.png" />

        <para><note>
            <para>The Router in the above diagram is assumed to NOT be doing
            SNAT for the hosts in the 192.168.2.0/24 network.</para>
          </note>The advantage of this approach is that the zone
        <quote>loc1</quote> can use CONTINUE policies such that if a
        connection request doesn't match a <quote>loc1</quote> rule, it will
        be matched against the <quote>loc</quote> rules. For example, if your
        loc1-&gt;net policy is CONTINUE then if a connection request from loc1
        to the Internet doesn't match any rules for loc1-&gt;net then it will
        be checked against the loc-&gt;net rules.</para>

  <section id="Special">
    <title>Some Hosts have Special Firewalling Requirements</title>

    <para>There are cases where a subset of the addresses associated with an
    interface need special handling. Here's an example.</para>

    <graphic fileref="images/MultiZone2.png" />

    <para>In this example, addresses 192.168.1.8 - 192.168.1.15
    (192.168.1.8/29) are to be treated as their own zone (loc1).</para>

    <para>The <option>broadcast</option> option causes limited broadcasts
    (destination IP address 255.255.255.255) to be checked against the loc1
    zone. If that zone allows the packet, then of course it will be seen by
    the mempers of loc that are outside of loc1 as well. If the broadcast is
    not specifically DROPped by the fw-&gt;loc1 rules then it will also be
    checked against the fw-&gt;loc rules, even if there is a DROP or REJECT
    fw-&gt;loc1 policy.</para>

    <para>You probably don't want Shorewall to set up infrastructure to route
    traffic between <quote>loc</quote> and <quote>loc1</quote> so you should
    add these two policies.</para>
