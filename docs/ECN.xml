  <warning>
    <para>2006-01-17. The ECN Netfilter target in some 2.6 Linux Kernels is
    broken. Symptoms are that you will be unable to establish a TCP connection
    to hosts defined in the /etc/shorewall/ecn file.</para>

    <title>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)</title>

    <para>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is described in RFC 3168 and
    is a proposed Internet standard. Unfortunately, not all sites support ECN
    and when a TCP connection offering ECN is sent to sites that don't support
    it, the result is often that the connection request is ignored.</para>

    <para>To allow ECN to be used, Shorewall allows you to enable ECN on your
    Linux systems then disable it in your firewall when the destination
    matches a list that you create (the /etc/shorewall/ecn file).</para>

    <para>You enable ECN by</para>

    <programlisting>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn</programlisting>

    <para>You must arrange for that command to be executed at system boot.
    Most distributions have a method for doing that -- on RedHat, you make an
    entry in /etc/sysctl.conf.</para>

    <programlisting>net.ipv4.tcp_ecn = 1</programlisting>

    <para>Entries in /etc/shorewall/ecn have two columns as follows:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>INTERFACE</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The name of an interface on your system</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>HOST(S)</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>An address (host or subnet) of a system or group of systems
          accessed through the interface in the first column. You may include
          a comma-separated list of such addresses in this column.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <example id="Example1">
      <title>Your external interface is eth0 and you want to disable ECN for
      tcp connections to 192.0.2.0/24:</title>

      <para><table id="Table1">
          <title>/etc/shorewall/ecn</title>

          <tgroup cols="2">
            <thead>
              <row>
                <entry align="center">INTERFACE</entry>

                <entry align="center">HOST(S)</entry>
              </row>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
              <row>
                <entry>eth0</entry>

                <entry>192.0.2.0/24</entry>
              </row>
            </tbody>
          </tgroup>
        </table></para>
    </example>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.6, you may also specify clearing of the
    ECN flags through use of the ECN action in <ulink
