  <section id="Introduction">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This guide is intended for users who are setting up Shorewall in an
    environment where a set of public IP addresses must be managed or who want
    to know more about Shorewall than is contained in the <ulink
    url="shorewall_quickstart_guide.htm">single-address guides</ulink>.
    Because the range of possible applications is so broad, the Guide will
    give you general guidelines and will point you to other resources as
    necessary.</para>

    <caution>
      <para>Shorewall requires that the iproute/iproute2 package be installed
      (on RedHat, the package is called iproute). You can tell if this package
      is installed by the presence of an <emphasis role="bold">ip</emphasis>
      program on your firewall system. As root, you can use the
      <quote>which</quote> command to check for this program:</para>

      <programlisting>[root@gateway root]# <command>which ip</command>
/sbin/ip
[root@gateway root]#</programlisting>

      <para>I recommend that you first read through the guide to familiarize
      yourself with what's involved then go back through it again making your
      configuration changes. Points at which configuration changes are
      recommended are flagged with <inlinegraphic
      fileref="images/BD21298_.gif"/>.</para>
    </caution>

    <caution>
      <para>If you edit your configuration files on a Windows system, you must
      save them as Unix files if your editor supports that option or you must
      run them through dos2unix before trying to use them with Shorewall.
      Similarly, if you copy a configuration file from your Windows hard drive
      to a floppy disk, you must run dos2unix against the copy before using it
      with Shorewall.</para>

    <para>The configuration files for Shorewall are contained in the directory
    <filename class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename> -- for most setups,
    you will only need to deal with a few of these as described in this guide.
    Skeleton files are created during the Shorewall <ulink
    url="Install.htm">Installation Process</ulink>.<warning>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Note to Debian Users</emphasis></para>

        <para>If you install using the .deb, you will find that your <filename
        class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename> directory is empty. This
        is intentional. The released configuration file skeletons may be found
        on your system in the directory <filename
        class="directory">/usr/share/doc/shorewall-common/default-config</filename>.
        Simply copy the files you need from that directory to <filename
        class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename> and modify the
        copies.</para>

        <para>Note that you must copy <filename
        class="directory">/usr/share/doc/shorewall-common/default-config/shorewall.conf</filename>
        and /usr/share/doc/shorewall-common/default-config/modules to
        <filename class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename> even if you do
        not modify those files.</para>
      </warning></para>

    <para>As each file is introduced, I suggest that you look through the
    actual file on your system -- each file contains detailed configuration
    instructions.</para>

    <para>Shorewall views the network where it is running as being composed of
    a set of zones. A zone is one or more hosts, which can be defined as
    individual hosts or networks in <filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/hosts</filename>, or as an entire
    interface in <filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename>. In this guide, we
    will use the following zones:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>Zones are defined in the file <filename><ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-zones.html"><filename>/etc/shorewall/zones</filename></ulink></filename>.</para>

    <important>
      <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/zones</filename> file included in the
      release is empty. You can create the standard set of zones described
      above by copying and pasting the following into the file:</para>

      <programlisting>#ZONE   TYPE             OPTIONS
fw      firewall
net     ipv4
loc     ipv4
dmz     ipv4</programlisting>
    </important>

    <para>Note that Shorewall recognizes the firewall system as its own zone -
    The above example follows the usual convention of naming the Firewall zone
    <emphasis role="bold">fw</emphasis>. The name specified for the firewall
    zone (<emphasis role="bold">fw</emphasis> in the above example) is stored
    in the shell variable <firstterm>$FW</firstterm> when the
    /etc/shorewall/zones file is processed. With the exception of the name
    assigned to the firewall zone, Shorewall attaches absolutely no meaning to
    zone names. Zones are entirely what YOU make of them. That means that you
    should not expect Shorewall to do something special <quote>because this is
    the Internet zone</quote> or <quote>because that is the
    DMZ</quote>.</para>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif"/></para>

    <para>Edit the /etc/shorewall/zones file and make any changes
    necessary.</para>

    <para>Rules about what traffic to allow and what traffic to deny are
    expressed in terms of zones.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>You express your default policy for connections from one zone to
        another zone in the <filename><ulink

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Shorewall is built on top of the <ulink
    url="http://www.netfilter.org">Netfilter</ulink> kernel facility.
    Netfilter implements a <ulink
    url="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jns/security/iptables/iptables_conntrack.html">connection
    tracking function</ulink> that allows what is often referred to as
    stateful inspection of packets. This stateful property allows firewall
    rules to be defined in terms of connections rather than in terms of
    packets. With Shorewall, you:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Identify destination (server) zone.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the POLICY from the client's zone to the server's zone is
        what you want for this client/server pair, you need do nothing
        further.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the POLICY is not what you want, then you must add a rule.
        That rule is expressed in terms of the client's zone and the server's
        zone.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Just because connections of a particular type are allowed from zone
    A to the firewall and are also allowed from the firewall to zone B
    <emphasis role="bold">DOES NOT mean that these connections are allowed
    from zone A to zone B</emphasis> (in other words, policies and rules
    involving the firewall zone are not transitive). It rather means that you
    can have a proxy running on the firewall that accepts a connection from
    zone A and then establishes its own separate connection from the firewall
    to zone B.</para>

    <para>For each connection request entering the firewall, the request is
    first checked against the <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename> file.
    If no rule in that file matches the connection request then the first
    policy in <filename>/etc/shorewall/policy</filename> that matches the
    request is applied after the request is passed to the appropriate <ulink
    url="Actions.html">default action</ulink> (if any).</para>

    <para>Prior to Shorewall 2.2.0, the default
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/policy</filename> file had the following
    policies:</para>

    <programlisting>#SOURCE ZONE     DESTINATION ZONE    POLICY     LOG     LIMIT:BURST
#                                               LEVEL

all              all                 REJECT     info</programlisting>

    <important>
      <para>The currently released policy file is empty. You can copy and
      paste the above entries to create a starting point from which to
      customize your policies.</para>
    </important>

    <para>The above policies will:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>allow all connection requests from your local network to the

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>reject all other connection requests and log a message at the

  <section id="Interfaces">
    <title>Network Interfaces</title>

    <para>For the remainder of this guide, we'll refer to the following
    diagram. While it may not look like your own network, it can be used to
    illustrate the important aspects of Shorewall configuration.</para>

    <para>In this diagram:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The DMZ Zone consists of systems DMZ 1 and DMZ 2. A DMZ is used
        to isolate your Internet-accessible servers from your local systems so
        that if one of those servers is compromised, you still have the
        firewall between the compromised system and your local systems.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The Local Zone consists of systems Local 1, Local 2 and Local
        3.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>All systems from the ISP outward comprise the Internet
        Zone.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <graphic align="center" fileref="images/dmz3.png"/>

    <para>The simplest way to define zones is to associate the zone name
    (previously defined in /etc/shorewall/zones) with a network interface.
    This is done in the <ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-interfaces.html">/etc/shorewall/interfaces</ulink>
    file. The firewall illustrated above has three network interfaces. Where
    Internet connectivity is through a cable or DSL <quote>Modem</quote>, the
    <emphasis>External Interface</emphasis> will be the Ethernet adapter that
    is connected to that <quote>Modem</quote> (e.g., <filename
    class="devicefile">eth0</filename>) unless you connect via Point-to-Point
    Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) or Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
    in which case the External Interface will be a ppp interface (e.g.,
    <filename class="devicefile">ppp0</filename>). If you connect via a
    regular modem, your External Interface will also be <filename
    class="devicefile">ppp0</filename>. If you connect using ISDN, you
    external interface will be <filename
    class="devicefile">ippp0</filename>.</para>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif"/></para>

    <para>If your external interface is <filename
    class="devicefile">ppp0</filename> or <filename
    class="devicefile">ippp0</filename> then you will want to set CLAMPMSS=yes
    in <filename><ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall.conf.html">/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</ulink></filename>.</para>

    <para>Your <emphasis>Local Interface</emphasis> will be an Ethernet
    adapter (<filename class="devicefile">eth0</filename>,
    <filename>eth1</filename> or <filename class="devicefile">eth2</filename>)
    and will be connected to a hub or switch. Your local computers will be
    connected to the same switch (note: If you have only a single local
    system, you can connect the firewall directly to the computer using a
    cross-over cable).</para>

    <para>Your <emphasis>DMZ Interface</emphasis> will also be an Ethernet
    adapter (<filename class="devicefile">eth0</filename>, <filename
    class="devicefile">eth1</filename> or <filename
    class="devicefile">eth2</filename>) and will be connected to a hub or
    switch. Your DMZ computers will be connected to the same switch (note: If
    you have only a single DMZ system, you can connect the firewall directly
    to the computer using a cross-over cable).</para>

    <caution>
      <para>Do not connect the internal and external interface to the same hub
      or switch except for testing. You can test using this kind of
      configuration if you specify the <emphasis
      role="bold">arp_filter</emphasis> option or the <emphasis
      role="bold">arp_ignore</emphasis> option in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename> for all interfaces
      connected to the common hub/switch. Using such a setup with a production
      firewall is strongly recommended against.</para>
    </caution>

    <para>For the remainder of this Guide, we will assume that:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The External Interface is <filename
        class="devicefile">eth0</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The Local Interface <filename
        class="devicefile">eth1</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The DMZ Interface <filename
        class="devicefile">eth2</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The Shorewall default configuration does not define the contents of
    any zone. To define the above configuration using the <ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-interfaces.html">/etc/shorewall/interfaces
    </ulink>file, that file would might contain:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE    INTERFACE      BROADCAST     OPTIONS
net      eth0           detect
loc      eth1           detect
dmz      eth2           detect</programlisting>

    <para>Note that the <emphasis role="bold">$FW</emphasis> zone has no entry
    in the /etc/shorewall/interfaces file.</para>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif"/></para>

    <para>Edit the <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename> file and
    define the network interfaces on your firewall and associate each
    interface with a zone. If you have a zone that is interfaced through more
    than one interface, simply include one entry for each interface and repeat
    the zone name as many times as necessary.</para>

    <example id="multi">
      <title>Multiple Interfaces to a Zone</title>

      <programlisting>#ZONE    INTERFACE      BROADCAST     OPTIONS
net      eth0           detect
loc      eth1           detect
loc      eth2           detect</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif"/></para>

    <para>You may define more complicated zones using the<filename> <ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-hosts.html">/etc/shorewall/hosts</ulink></filename>
    file but in most cases, that isn't necessary. See <ulink
    url="Shorewall_and_Aliased_Interfaces.html">Shorewall_and_Aliased_Interfaces.html</ulink>
    and <ulink url="Multiple_Zones.html">Multiple_Zones.html</ulink> for
    examples.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="Addressing">
    <title>Addressing, Subnets and Routing</title>

    <para>Normally, your ISP will assign you a set of Public IP addresses. You
    will configure your firewall's external interface to use one of those
    addresses permanently and you will then have to decide how you are going
    to use the rest of your addresses. Before we tackle that question though,
    some background is in order.</para>

    <para>If you are thoroughly familiar with IP addressing and routing, you
    may go to the next section.</para>

    <para>The following discussion barely scratches the surface of addressing
    and routing. If you are interested in learning more about this subject, I
    highly recommend <quote><emphasis>IP Fundamentals: What Everyone Needs to
    Know about Addressing &amp; Routing</emphasis></quote>, Thomas A. Maufer,
    Prentice-Hall, 1999, ISBN 0-13-975483-0.</para>

    <section id="Addresses">
      <title>IP Addresses</title>

      <para>IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses are 32-bit numbers. The notation
      w.x.y.z refers to an address where the high-order byte has value
      <quote>w</quote>, the next byte has value <quote>x</quote>, etc. If we
      take the address 192.0.2.14 and express it in hexadecimal, we
      get:</para>

      <para><programlisting>C0.00.02.0E</programlisting>or looking at it as a
      32-bit integer</para>

      <para><programlisting>C000020E</programlisting></para>
    </section>

    <section id="Subnets">
      <title>Subnets</title>

      <para>You will still hear the terms <quote>Class A network</quote>,
      <quote>Class B network</quote> and <quote>Class C network</quote>. In
      the early days of IP, networks only came in three sizes (there were also
      Class D networks but they were used differently):</para>

      <simplelist>
        <member>Class A - netmask 255.0.0.0, size = 2 ** 24</member>

        <member>Class B - netmask 255.255.0.0, size = 2 ** 16</member>

        <member>Class C - netmask 255.255.255.0, size = 256</member>
      </simplelist>

      <para>The class of a network was uniquely determined by the value of the
      high order byte of its address so you could look at an IP address and
      immediately determine the associated netmask. The netmask is a number
      that when logically ANDed with an address isolates the network number;
      the remainder of the address is the host number. For example, in the
      Class C address 192.0.2.14, the network number is hex C00002 and the
      host number is hex 0E.</para>

      <para>As the Internet grew, it became clear that such a gross
      partitioning of the 32-bit address space was going to be very limiting
      (early on, large corporations and universities were assigned their own
      class A network!). After some false starts, the current technique of
      subnetting these networks into smaller subnetworks evolved; that
      technique is referred to as <emphasis>Classless InterDomain
      Routing</emphasis> (CIDR). Today, any system that you are likely to work
      with will understand CIDR and Class-based networking is largely a thing
      of the past.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>subnetwork</emphasis> (often referred to as a
      <emphasis>subnet</emphasis>) is a contiguous set of IP addresses such
      that:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The number of addresses in the set is a power of 2; and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The first address in the set is a multiple of the set
          size.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The first address in the subnet is reserved and is referred to
          as the <emphasis>subnet address</emphasis>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The last address in the subnet is reserved as the subnet's
          <emphasis>broadcast address</emphasis>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>As you can see by this definition, in each subnet of size n there
      are (n - 2) usable addresses (addresses that can be assigned to hosts).
      The first and last address in the subnet are used for the subnet address
      and subnet broadcast address respectively. Consequently, small
      subnetworks are more wasteful of IP addresses than are large
      ones.</para>

      <para>Since n is a power of two, we can easily calculate the
      <emphasis>Base-2 Logarithm</emphasis> (log2) of n. For the more common

      <para>Notice that the VLSM is written with a slash (<quote>/</quote>) --
      you will often hear a subnet of size 64 referred to as a <quote>slash
      26</quote> subnet and one of size 8 referred to as a <quote>slash
      29</quote>.</para>

      <para>The subnet's mask (also referred to as its
      <emphasis>netmask</emphasis>) is simply a 32-bit number with the first
      <quote>VLSM</quote> bits set to one and the remaining bits set to zero.
      For example, for a subnet of size 64, the subnet mask has 26 leading one
      bits:</para>

      <para><programlisting>11111111111111111111111111000000 = FFFFFFC0 = FF.FF.FF.C0 = 255.255.255.192</programlisting>The
      subnet mask has the property that if you logically AND the subnet mask
      with an address in the subnet, the result is the subnet address. Just as
      important, if you logically AND the subnet mask with an address outside
      the subnet, the result is NOT the subnet address. As we will see below,
      this property of subnet masks is very useful in routing.</para>

      <para>For a subnetwork whose address is <emphasis

      gateway which is usually a router at your ISP. Lets take an example.
      Suppose that we want to route a packet to 192.168.1.5. That address
      clearly doesn't match any of the host routes in the table but if we
      logically and that address with 255.255.255.0, the result is 192.168.1.0
      which matches this routing table entry:</para>

      <para><programlisting>192.168.1.0   0.0.0.0       255.255.255.0   U     40  0         0 eth2</programlisting></para>

      <para>So to route a packet to 192.168.1.5, the packet is sent directly
      over eth2.</para>

      <para>One more thing needs to be emphasized -- all outgoing packet are
      sent using the routing table and reply packets are not a special case.
      There seems to be a common misconception whereby people think that
      request packets are like salmon and contain a genetic code that is
      magically transferred to reply packets so that the replies follow the
      reverse route taken by the request. That isn't the case; the replies may
      take a totally different route back to the client than was taken by the
      requests -- they are totally independent.</para>

      <title>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</title>

      <para>When sending packets over Ethernet, IP addresses aren't used.
      Rather Ethernet addressing is based on <emphasis>Media Access
      Control</emphasis> (MAC) addresses. Each Ethernet device has its own
      unique MAC address which is burned into a PROM on the device during
      manufacture. You can obtain the MAC of an Ethernet device using the
      <quote>ip</quote> utility:</para>

      <programlisting>[root@gateway root]# <command>ip addr show eth0</command>
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc htb qlen 100

      <para>As you can see from the above output, the MAC is 6 bytes (48 bits)
      wide. A card's MAC is usually also printed on a label attached to the
      card itself. Because IP uses IP addresses and Ethernet uses MAC
      addresses, a mechanism is required to translate an IP address into a MAC
      address; that is the purpose of the <emphasis>Address Resolution
      Protocol </emphasis>(ARP). Here is ARP in action:</para>

      option) which causes the <quote>arp</quote> program to forgo IP-&gt;DNS

    <section id="RFC1918">
      <title>RFC 1918</title>

      <para>IP addresses are allocated by the <ulink
      url="http://www.iana.org/">Internet Assigned Number Authority</ulink>
      (IANA) who delegates allocations on a geographic basis to Regional
      Internet Registries (RIRs). For example, allocation for the Americas and
      for sub-Sahara Africa is delegated to the <ulink
      url="http://www.arin.net/">American Registry for Internet
      Numbers</ulink> (ARIN). These RIRs may in turn delegate to national
      registries. Most of us don't deal with these registrars but rather get
      our IP addresses from our ISP. It's a fact of life that most of us can't
      afford as many Public IP addresses as we have devices to assign them to
      so we end up making use of Private IP addresses. RFC 1918 reserves
      several IP address ranges for this purpose:</para>

      <programlisting>10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255</programlisting>

      <para>The addresses reserved by RFC 1918 are sometimes referred to as
      <firstterm>non-routable</firstterm> because the Internet backbone
      routers don't forward packets which have an RFC-1918 destination
      address. This is understandable given that anyone can select any of
      these addresses for their private use but the term non-routable is
      somewhat unfortunate because it leads people to the erroneous conclusion
      that traffic destined for one of these addresses can't be sent through a
      router. This is definitely not true; private routers (including your
      Shorewall-based firewall) can forward RFC 1918 addressed traffic just
      fine.</para>

      <para>When selecting addresses from these ranges, there's a couple of
      things to keep in mind:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>As the IPv4 address space becomes depleted, more and more
          organizations (including ISPs) are beginning to use RFC 1918
          addresses in their infrastructure.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You don't want to use addresses that are being used by your
          ISP or by another organization with whom you want to establish a VPN
          relationship.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>So it's a good idea to check with your ISP to see if they are
      using (or are planning to use) private addresses before you decide the
      addresses that you are going to use.</para>

    <para>The choice of how to set up your network depends primarily on how
    many Public IP addresses you have vs. how many addressable entities you

    will handle that set of addresses in one of two ways:</para>

        the IP address of your firewall/router's external interface.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>In the subsections that follow, we'll look at each of these
    separately.</para>

    <para>Before we begin, there is one thing for you to check:</para>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif"/></para>

    <section id="Routed">
      <title>Routed</title>

      <para>Let's assume that your ISP has assigned you the subnet
      192.0.2.64/28 routed through 192.0.2.65. That means that you have IP
      addresses 192.0.2.64 - 192.0.2.79 and that your firewall's external IP
      address is 192.0.2.65. Your ISP has also told you that you should use a
      netmask of 255.255.255.0 (so your /28 is part of a larger /24). With
      this many IP addresses, you are able to subnet your /28 into two /29's
      and set up your network as shown in the following diagram.</para>

      <graphic align="center" fileref="images/dmz4.png"/>

      <para>Here, the DMZ comprises the subnet 192.0.2.64/29 and the Local
      network is 192.0.2.72/29. The default gateway for hosts in the DMZ would
      be configured to 192.0.2.66 and the default gateway for hosts in the
      local network would be 192.0.2.73.</para>

      <para>Notice that this arrangement is rather wasteful of public IP
      addresses since it is using 192.0.2.64 and 192.0.2.72 for subnet
      addresses, 192.0.2.71 and 192.0.2.79 for subnet broadcast addresses and
      192.0.2.66 and 168.0.2.73 for internal addresses on the firewall/router.
      Nevertheless, it shows how subnetting can work and if we were dealing
      with a /24 rather than a /28 network, the use of 6 IP addresses out of
      256 would be justified because of the simplicity of the setup.</para>

      <para>The astute reader may have noticed that the Firewall/Router's
      external interface is actually part of the DMZ subnet (192.0.2.64/29).
      What if DMZ 1 (192.0.2.67) tries to communicate with 192.0.2.65? The
      routing table on DMZ 1 will look like this:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific">Kernel IP routing table
Destination    Gateway     Genmask         Flags MSS Window irtt Iface
192.0.2.64     0.0.0.0     255.255.255.248 U     40  0         0 eth0
0.0.0.0        192.0.2.66  0.0.0.0         UG    40  0         0 eth0</programlisting>

      <para>This means that DMZ 1 will send an ARP <quote>who-has
      192.0.2.65</quote> request and no device on the DMZ Ethernet segment has
      that IP address. Oddly enough, the firewall will respond to the request
      with the MAC address of its <emphasis role="underline">DMZ
      Interface</emphasis>!! DMZ 1 can then send Ethernet frames addressed to
      that MAC address and the frames will be received (correctly) by the
      firewall/router.</para>

      <para>It is this rather unexpected ARP behavior on the part of the Linux
      Kernel that prompts the warning earlier in this guide regarding the
      connecting of multiple firewall/router interfaces to the same hub or
      switch. When an ARP request for one of the firewall/router's IP
      addresses is sent by another system connected to the hub/switch, all of
      the firewall's interfaces that connect to the hub/switch can respond! It
      is then a race as to which <quote>here-is</quote> response reaches the
      sender first.</para>

    <section id="NonRouted">
      <title>Non-routed</title>

      <para>If you have the above situation but it is non-routed, you can
      configure your network exactly as described above with one additional
      twist; simply specify the <quote>proxyarp</quote> option on all three
      firewall interfaces in the /etc/shorewall/interfaces file.</para>

      <para>Most of us don't have the luxury of having enough public IP

      <para><emphasis role="bold">For the remainder of this section, assume

        <para>With one-to-one NAT, you assign local systems RFC 1918 addresses
        then establish a one-to-one mapping between those addresses and public
        IP addresses. For outgoing connections SNAT (Source Network Address
        Translation) occurs and on incoming connections DNAT (Destination
        Network Address Translation) occurs. Let's go back to our earlier

      just to see if there is anything there that might be of interest. You
      might also want to look at the other configuration files that you
      haven't touched yet just to get a feel for the other things that
      Shorewall can do.</para>

      <para>In case you haven't been keeping score, here's the final set of
      configuration files for our sample network. Only those that were
      modified from the original installation are shown.</para>

      <para>The setup described here requires that your network interfaces be
      brought up before Shorewall can start. This opens a short window during
      which you have no firewall protection. If you replace
      <quote>detect</quote> with the actual broadcast addresses in the entries

    <para>Given the collection of RFC 1918 and public addresses in this setup,
    it only makes sense to have separate internal and external DNS servers.
    You can combine the two into a single BIND 9 server using Views. If you
    are not interested in Bind 9 views, you can go to the next section.</para>

    <para>Suppose that your domain is foobar.net and you want the two DMZ
    systems named www.foobar.net and mail.foobar.net and you want the three
    local systems named "winken.foobar.net, blinken.foobar.net and
    nod.foobar.net. You want your firewall to be known as firewall.foobar.net
    externally and its interface to the local network to be know as
    gateway.foobar.net and its interface to the dmz as dmz.foobar.net. Let's
    have the DNS server on 192.0.2.177 which will also be known by the name
    ns1.foobar.net.</para>

    <title>Some Things to Keep in Mind</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">You cannot test your firewall from the
        inside</emphasis>. Just because you send requests to your firewall
        external IP address does not mean that the request will be associated
        with the external interface or the <quote>net</quote> zone. Any
        traffic that you generate from the local network will be associated
        with your local interface and will be treated as loc-&gt;$FW
        traffic.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">IP addresses are properties of systems,
        not of interfaces</emphasis>. It is a mistake to believe that your
        firewall is able to forward packets just because you can ping the IP
        address of all of the firewall's interfaces from the local network.
        The only conclusion you can draw from such pinging success is that the
        link between the local system and the firewall works and that you
        probably have the local system's default gateway set correctly.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">All IP addresses configured on firewall
        interfaces are in the $FW (fw) zone</emphasis>. If 192.168.1.254 is
        the IP address of your internal interface then you can write
        <quote><emphasis role="bold">$FW:192.168.1.254</emphasis></quote> in a
        rule but you may not write <quote><emphasis
        role="bold">loc:192.168.1.254</emphasis></quote>. Similarly, it is
        nonsensical to add 192.168.1.254 to the <emphasis
        role="bold">loc</emphasis> zone using an entry in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/hosts</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Reply packets do NOT automatically follow
        the reverse path of the one taken by the original request</emphasis>.
        All packets are routed according to the routing table of the host at
        each step of the way. This issue commonly comes up when people install
        a Shorewall firewall parallel to an existing gateway and try to use
        DNAT through Shorewall without changing the default gateway of the
        system receiving the forwarded requests. Requests come in through the
        Shorewall firewall where the destination IP address gets rewritten but
        replies go out unmodified through the old gateway.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Shorewall itself has no notion of inside
        or outside</emphasis>. These concepts are embodied in how Shorewall is
        configured.</para>

    <title>Starting and Stopping the Firewall</title>

    <para>The <ulink url="Install.htm">Installation procedure</ulink>
    configures your system to start Shorewall at system boot.</para>

    <para>The firewall is started using the <quote>shorewall start</quote>
    command and stopped using <quote>shorewall stop</quote>. When the firewall
    is stopped, routing is enabled on those hosts that have an ACCEPT entry in
    <filename><ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-stoppedrules.html">/etc/shorewall/stoppedrules</ulink></filename>.
    A running firewall may be restarted using the <quote>shorewall
    restart</quote> command. If you want to totally remove any trace of
    Shorewall from your Netfilter configuration, use <quote>shorewall
    clear</quote>.</para>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif"/></para>

    <para>Edit the <filename><ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-stoppedrules.html">/etc/shorewall/stoppedrules</ulink></filename>
    file and add ACCEPT rules for those systems that you want to be able to
    access the firewall when it is stopped.</para>

    <caution>
      <para>If you are connected to your firewall from the Internet, do not
      issue a <quote>shorewall stop</quote> command unless you have added an
      ACCEPT entry for the IP address that you are connected from to
      <filename><ulink
      url="manpages/shorewall-stoppedrules.html">/etc/shorewall/stoppedrules</ulink></filename>.
      Also, I don't recommend using <quote>shorewall restart</quote>; it is
      better to create an <ulink
      url="starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm"><emphasis>an alternate
      configuration</emphasis></ulink> and test it using the <quote><ulink
      url="starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm"><command>shorewall
      try</command></ulink></quote> command.</para>
