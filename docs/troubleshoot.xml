    Errors</title>

    <para>If the error is detected by the Shorewall compiler, it should be
    fairly obvious where the problem was found. Each error message includes
    the configuration file name and line number where the error was detected
    and often gives the particular item in error. The item is either enclosed
    in parentheses or is at the end following a colon (":").</para>

    <para>Example:<programlisting>gateway:~/test # shorewall restart .
Compiling...
   ERROR: Invalid ICMP Type (0/400) : /root/test/rules (line 19)
gateway:~/test # </programlisting>In this case, line 19 in the rules file
    specified an invalid ICMP Type (0/400).</para>

    <para>Additional information about the error can be obtained using the
    'debug' keyword (Shorewall 4.4.19 and earlier) or using the (-T)
    option.</para>

    <para>This information is useful to Shorewall support if you need to
    <ulink url="support.html">file a problem report</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The end of the compile phase is signaled by a message such as the
    following:<programlisting>Shorewall configuration compiled to /var/lib/shorewall/.restart</programlisting>Errors
    occurring past that point are said to occur at
    <firstterm>run-time</firstterm> because they occur during the running of
    the compiled firewall script (/var/lib/shorewall/.restart in the case of
    the above message).</para>

    <para>One common run-time failure is that the iptables-restore program
    encounters an error. This will produce an error such as the
    following:<programlisting>...
Restarting Shorewall....

Error occurred at line: 83

gateway:~/test # </programlisting>A look at /var/lib/shorewall/restore at line
    83 might show something like the following:<programlisting>-A reject -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset</programlisting>In
    this case, the user had compiled his own kernel and had forgotten to
    include REJECT target support (see <ulink

    <para>You may also include the word <emphasis role="bold">debug</emphasis>
    as the first argument to the <filename>/sbin/shorewall</filename> and
    <filename>/sbin/shorewall-lite</filename> commands.<programlisting><command>shorewall debug restart</command></programlisting>In
    most cases, <emphasis role="bold">debug</emphasis> is a synonym for
    <emphasis role="bold">trace</emphasis>. The exceptions are:</para>

        to <command>iptables-restore</command> in its input file are passed
        individually to <command>iptables</command>. This is a diagnostic aid
        which allows identifying the individual command that is causing
        <command>iptables-restore</command> to fail; it should be used when

  </section>

  <section id="Network">
    <title>Your Network Environment</title>

    <para>Many times when people have problems with Shorewall, the problem is
    actually an ill-conceived network setup. Here are several popular
    snafus:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Port Forwarding where client and server are in the same subnet.
        See <ulink url="FAQ.htm#faq2">FAQ 2</ulink>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Trying to test net-&gt;loc DNAT rules from inside your firewall.
        You must test these rules from <emphasis
        role="bold">outside</emphasis> your firewall.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Multiple interfaces connected to the same HUB or Switch. Given
        the way that the Linux kernel respond to ARP <quote>who-has</quote>
        requests, this type of setup <emphasis role="bold">does NOT work the
        way that you expect it to</emphasis>. You can test using this kind of
        configuration if you specify the <emphasis
        role="bold">arp_filter</emphasis> option or the <emphasis
        role="bold">arp_ignore</emphasis> option in <filename><ulink
        url="manpages/shorewall-interfaces.html">/etc/shorewall/interfaces</ulink></filename>
        for all interfaces connected to the common hub/switch. <emphasis
        role="bold">Using such a setup with a production firewall is strongly
        recommended against</emphasis>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section id="NewDevice">
    <title>New Device Doesn't Work?</title>

    <para>If you have just added a new device such as VOIP and it doesn't
    work, be sure that you have assigned it an IP address in your local
    network and that its default gateway has been set to the IP address of
    your internal interface. For many of these devices, the simplest solution
    is to run a DHCP server; running it on your firewall is fine — be sure to
    set the <emphasis role="bold">dhcp</emphasis> option on your internal
    interface in <ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-interfaces.html">/etc/shorewall/interfaces</ulink>.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="Connections">
    <title>Connection Problems</title>

    <para>One very important thing to remember is that not all connection
    problems are Shorewall configuration problems. If the connection that is
    giving you problems is to or from the firewall system or if it doesn't
    rely on NAT or Proxy ARP then you can often eliminate Shorewall using a
    simple test:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><command>/sbin/shorewall clear</command></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Try the connection. If it works then the problem is in your
        Shorewall configuration; if the connection still doesn't work then the
        problem is not with Shorewall or the way that it is configured.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Be sure to <command>/sbin/shorewall start</command> after the
        test.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If you still suspect Shorewall and the appropriate policy for the
    connection that you are trying to make is ACCEPT, please DO NOT ADD
    ADDITIONAL ACCEPT RULES TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK. Such additional rules will
    NEVER make it work, they add clutter to your rule set and they represent a
    big security hole in the event that you forget to remove them
    later.</para>

    <para>I also recommend against setting all of your policies to ACCEPT in
    an effort to make something work. That robs you of one of your best
    diagnostic tools - the <quote>Shorewall</quote> messages that Netfilter
    will generate when you try to connect in a way that isn't permitted by
    your rule set.</para>

    <para>Check your log (<quote><command>/sbin/shorewall show
    log</command></quote>). If you don't see Shorewall messages, then your
    problem is probably NOT a Shorewall problem. If you DO see packet
    messages, it may be an indication that you are missing one or more rules
    -- see <ulink url="FAQ.htm#faq17">FAQ 17</ulink>.</para>

    <para>While you are troubleshooting, it is a good idea to clear LOGLIMIT
    in
    <filename><filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename></filename>:</para>

    <para><programlisting>LOGLIMIT=</programlisting>This way, you will see all
    of the log messages being generated (be sure to restart shorewall after
    clearing thIs variable).</para>

  <section id="Ping">
    <title>Ping Problems</title>

    <para>Either can't ping when you think you should be able to or are able
    to ping when you think that you shouldn't be allowed? Shorewall's
    <quote>Ping</quote> Management is <ulink url="ping.html">described
    here</ulink>. Here are a couple of tips:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Remember that Shorewall doesn't automatically allow ICMP type 8
        (<quote>ping</quote>) requests to be sent between zones. If you want
        pings to be allowed between zones, you need a rule of the form:</para>

        <programlisting>#ACTION  SOURCE          DEST                  PROTO   DEST
#                                                      PORT(S)
Ping(ACCEPT)<emphasis>&lt;source zone&gt;</emphasis> <emphasis>&lt;destination zone&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

        <para>The ramifications of this can be subtle. For example, if you
        have the following in <filename><ulink
        url="NAT.htm">/etc/shorewall/nat</ulink></filename>:</para>

        <programlisting>#EXTERNAL   INTERFACE  INTERNAL
10.1.1.2 eth0       130.252.100.18</programlisting>

        <para>and you ping 130.252.100.18, unless you have allowed icmp type 8
        between the zone containing the system you are pinging from and the
        zone containing 10.1.1.2, the ping requests will be dropped.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Ping requests are subject to logging under your policies. So
        ping floods can cause an equally big flood of log messages. To
        eliminate these, as the last rule in your /etc/shorewall/rules file
        add:</para>

        <programlisting>#ACTION  SOURCE          DEST                  PROTO   DEST
#                                                      PORT(S)

        <para><emphasis role="bold">You cannot test your firewall from the
        inside</emphasis>. Just because you send requests to your firewall

        with the external interface or the <quote>net</quote> zone. Any
        traffic that you generate from the local network will be associated
        with your local interface and will be treated as loc-&gt;fw
        traffic.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">IP addresses are properties of systems,

        firewall is able to forward packets just because you can ping the IP
        address of all of the firewall's interfaces from the local network.
        The only conclusion you can draw from such pinging success is that the
        link between the local system and the firewall works and that you
        probably have the local system's default gateway set correctly.</para>

        a Shorewall firewall parallel to an existing gateway and try to use
        DNAT through Shorewall without changing the default gateway of the
        system receiving the forwarded requests. Requests come in through the

        <para>Is your routing correct? For example, internal systems usually
        need to be configured with their default gateway set to the IP address
        of their nearest firewall interface. One often overlooked aspect of
        routing is that in order for two hosts to communicate, the routing
        between them must be set up <emphasis role="bold">in both
        directions</emphasis>. So when setting up routing between <emphasis
        role="bold">A</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>, be
        sure to verify that the route from <emphasis role="bold">B</emphasis>
        back to <emphasis role="bold">A</emphasis> is defined and
        correct.</para>
