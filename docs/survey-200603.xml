    <title>The Shorewall Environment Survey 2006</title>

    <para>In early March 2006, i @@@ embarked on the jorney of surveying
    Shorewall users. Initially this sprang from my own curiosity: it seemed to
    me that the systems at work on which i was using Shorewall were bigger and
    more complex than a lot of the ones others were using, and i wanted to
    find out if there were people out there who used it like i did. As started
    thinking about the question's i would ask, i realised that i could ask a
    few more questions that might help us as a project to understand a bit
    more about all of our users.</para>

    <para>I used <ulink url="http://www.zoomerang.com">Zoomerang</ulink> to
    create the survey. It has a number of tools that make it really easy to
    create useful surveys. To get the most benefit out of Zoomerang, you have
    to subscribe to their professional version. In the long term, it would be
    great to see a practical free software alternative that we could
    self-host. A number of free content management systems such as <ulink
    url="http://drupal.org">Drupal</ulink> have a survey module, but when i
    last looked at them, they</para>

      Zoomerang survey page</ulink>. Further participation is encouraged. The

        <title>Organisations</title>

        <para>Small organisations dominate the spectrum of Shorewall users.
        The largest group (44%) was 1-10 users - mostly SOHO LANs, based on
        the comments in that section. Ninety percent of Shorewall
        installations are in organisations with less than 500 users.</para>

        <para>The results for the questions about organisational size and the
        number of users serviced by Shorewall closely match, which seems to
        indicate that the majority of those 90% of Shorewall systems are
        servicing the entire organisation in question.</para>

        <para>Some anomalies seem to have crept in, e.g. some responses
        indicated that their Shorewall system serviced more users than exist
        in their organisation. There may be some good reasons for this that
        i'm not aware of.</para>

        <para>The vast majority (84%) of Shorewall systems are administered by
        only one person. Possible reasons for this might be:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Most of the organisations in which it is used are small, and
            so most of them will only have one person skilled in the area of
            packet filtering firewalls. This seems a likely scenario, but a
            cross</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Shorewall is too hard for new users to comprehend, so one
            skilled person in an organisation tends to get the job maintaining
            it.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Shorewall works so well that people don't have to touch it
            much. (This is obviously the preferred interpretation of the
            Shorewall project team. :-)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Shorewall administrators are a closed bunch and don't like
            sharing their job around. Given the nature of packet filtering,
            this doesn't seem far-fetched.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>This question doesn't seem to have an easy answer. In
        retrospect, since there were no responses indicating 10 or more
        administrators, i could have made the granularity of this question
        better. Possibly we can follow this up with a further, smaller survey
        specifically about the people and organisations who use
        Shorewall.</para>
