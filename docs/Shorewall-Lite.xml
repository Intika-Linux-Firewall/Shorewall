    <para>Shorewall has the capability to compile a Shorewall configuration
    and produce a runnable firewall program script. The script is a complete
    program which can be placed on a system with <emphasis>Shorewall
    Lite</emphasis> installed and can serve as the firewall creation script
    for that system.</para>

    <section id="Lite">
      <title>Shorewall Lite</title>

      <para>Shorewall Lite is a companion product to Shorewall and is designed

          <para>Older versions of Shorewall included copies of shorewall.conf

          <para>Prior to Shorewall 4.5.8, the

          compiler generates. All other settings were taken from the
          <filename>shorewall.conf </filename>file in the remote systems
          export directory.</para>

          <caution>
            <para>Prior to Shorewall 4.5.8, if you want to be able to allow
            non-root users to manage remote firewall systems, then the files
            <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> and
            <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename> must be
            readable by all users on the administrative system. Not all
            packages secure the files that way and you may have to change the
            file permissions yourself.</para>

            <para>Prior to Shorewall 4.5.14,
            <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> must be readable by

              <para>It is important to understand that with Shorewall Lite,
              the firewall's export directory on the administrative system
              acts as <filename class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename>
              for that firewall. So when the Shorewall documentation gives
              instructions for placing entries in files in the firewall's
              <filename class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename>, when
              using Shorewall Lite you make those changes in the firewall's

        <para>As with a normal Shorewall configuration, the shorewall.conf

        <filename>helpers</filename> file (LOAD_HELPERS_ONLY=Yes) is used.
        Normally, the file on the firewall system is used. If you want to
        specify modules at compile time on the Administrative System, then you
        must place a copy of the appropriate file
        (<filename>modules</filename> or <filename>helpers</filename>) in the
        firewall's configuration directory before compilation.</para>

        <para>In Shorewall 4.4.17, the EXPORTMODULES option was added to
        shorewall.conf (and shorewall6.conf). When EXPORTMODULES=Yes, any

    <para>As you can see, the file contains a simple list of shell variable
    assignments — the variables correspond to the capabilities listed by the
    <command>shorewall show capabilities</command> command and they appear in
    the same order as the output of that command.</para>

    <para>To aid in creating this file, Shorewall Lite includes a
    <command>shorecap</command> program. The program is installed in the
    <filename class="directory">/usr/share/shorewall-lite/</filename>
    directory and may be run as follows:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><command>[ IPTABLES=&lt;iptables binary&gt; ] [

    <para>The IPTABLES and MODULESDIR options have their <ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall.conf.html">usual Shorewall default
    values</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The <filename>capabilities</filename> file may then be copied to a
    system with Shorewall installed and used when compiling firewall programs
    to run on the remote system.</para>

    <para>The <filename>capabilities</filename> file may also be creating
    using <filename>/sbin/shorewall-lite</filename>:<blockquote>
        <para><command>shorewall-lite show -f capabilities &gt;
        capabilities</command></para>
      </blockquote></para>

    <para>Note that unlike the <command>shorecap</command> program, the
    <command>show capabilities</command> command shows the kernel's current
    capabilities; it does not attempt to load additional kernel
    modules.</para>
