  <warning>
    <para>Reading just Shorewall documentation is probably not going to give
    you enough background to use this material. Shorewall may make iptables
    easy but the Shorewall team doesn't have the resources to be able to
    spoon-feed Linux policy routing to you (please remember that the user's
    manual for a tractor doesn't teach you to grow corn either). You will
    likely need to refer to the following additional information:</para>

      <para>Let's assume that a firewall is connected via two separate
      Ethernet interfaces to two different ISPs.<footnote>
          <para>While we describe a setup using different ISPs in this
          article, the facility also works with two uplinks from the same
          ISP.</para>
        </footnote> as in the following diagram.</para>

      <graphic align="center" fileref="images/TwoISPs.png" valign="middle" />

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>eth0 connects to ISP1. The IP address of eth0 is
          206.124.146.176 and the ISP's gateway router has IP address
          206.124.146.254.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>eth1 connects to ISP 2. The IP address of eth1 is
          130.252.99.27 and the ISP's gateway router has IP address
          130.252.99.254.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>eth2 connects to the local LAN. Its IP configuration is not
          relevant to this discussion.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Each of these <firstterm>providers</firstterm> is described in an
      entry in the file <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename>.</para>

      <para>Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename> can
      specify that outgoing connections are to be load-balanced between the
      two ISPs. Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> and
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</filename> can be used to direct
      particular outgoing connections to one ISP or the other. Use of
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> is not required for
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename> to work, but in most
      cases, you must select a unique MARK value for each provider so
      Shorewall can set up the correct marking rules for you.</para>

      <para>When you use the <emphasis role="bold">track</emphasis> option in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename>, connections from the
      Internet are automatically routed back out of the correct interface and
      through the correct ISP gateway. This works whether the connection is
      handled by the firewall itself or if it is routed or port-forwarded to a
      system behind the firewall.</para>

      <para>Shorewall will set up the routing and will update the
      <filename>/etc/iproute2/rt_tables</filename> to include the table names
      and numbers of the tables that it adds.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>This feature uses <ulink url="traffic_shaping.htm">packet
        marking</ulink> to control the routing. As a consequence, there are
        some restrictions concerning entries in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename>:</para>

                  outgoing connections remain stay anchored to a single
                  provider and don't try to switch providers when route cache
                  entries expire.</para>

                  perfect, as it is route based, and routes are cached. This
                  means that routes to often-used sites will always be over

                  <para>By default, each provider is given the same weight (1)

                  desired weight (e.g., balance=2). The weights reflect the
                  relative bandwidth of the providers connections and should
                  be small numbers since the kernel actually creates
                  additional default routes for each weight increment.</para>

      <title>What an entry in the Providers File Does</title>

      <para>Adding another entry in the providers file simply creates an
      alternate routing table for you (see the<ulink
      url="http://www.lartc.org"> LARTC Howto</ulink>). The table will usually
      contain two routes:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A host route to the specified GATEWAY through the specified
          INTERFACE.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A default route through the GATEWAY.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Note that the first route is omitted if "-" is specified as the
      GATEWAY; in that case, the default route does not specify a gateway
      (point-to-point link).</para>

      <para>If the DUPLICATE column is non-empty, then routes from the table
      named in that column are copied into the new table. By default, all
      routes (except default routes) are copied. The set of routes copied can
      be restricted using the COPY column which lists the interfaces whose
      routes you want copied. You will generally want to include all local
      interfaces in this list. You should exclude the loopback interface (lo)
      and any interfaces that do not have an IP configuration. You should also
      omit interfaces like <emphasis role="bold">tun</emphasis> interfaces
      that are created dynamically. Traffic to networks handled by those
      interfaces should be routed through the main table using entries in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</filename> (see Example 2 <link
      linkend="Examples">below</link>) or by using <link
      linkend="USE_DEFAULT_RT">USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes</link>.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Unless <emphasis role="bold">loose</emphasis> is specified, an
          ip rule is generated for each IP address on the INTERFACE that
          routes traffic from that address through the associated routing
          table.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you specify <emphasis role="bold">track</emphasis>, then
          connections which have had at least one packet arrive on the
          interface listed in the INTERFACE column have their connection mark
          set to the value in the MARK column. In the PREROUTING chain,
          packets with a connection mark have their packet mark set to the
          value of the associated connection mark; packets marked in this way
          bypass any prerouting rules that you create in
          <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename>. This ensures that
          packets associated with connections from outside are always routed
          out of the correct interface.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you specify <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis>, then
          Shorewall will replace the 'default' route with weight 100 in the
          'main' routing table with a load-balancing route among those
          gateways where <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis> was
          specified. So if you configure default routes, be sure that their
          weight is less than 100 or the route added by Shorewall will not be
          used.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Once routing determines where the packet is to go, the

      <para>The bottom line is that if you want traffic to go out through a

      with the provider's MARK value in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> and you must do that marking

    <section>
      <title>/etc/shorewall/masq and Multi-ISP</title>

      <para>If you masquerade a local network, you will need to add masquerade
      rules for both external interfaces. Referring to the diagram above, if
      each of the interfaces has only a single IP address and you have no
      systems with public IP addresses behind your firewall, then I suggest
      the following simple entries:</para>

      <programlisting>#INTERFACE       SOURCE            ADDRESS
eth0             0.0.0.0/0         206.124.146.176
eth1             0.0.0.0/0         130.252.99.27</programlisting>

      <para>If you have a public subnet (for example 206.124.146.176/30)
      behind your firewall, then use exclusion:</para>

      <programlisting>#INTERFACE       SOURCE               ADDRESS
eth0             !206.124.146.176/29  206.124.146.176
eth1             0.0.0.0/0            130.252.99.27</programlisting>

      <para>Note that exclusion is only used on the interface corresponding to
      internal subnetwork.</para>

      <para>If you have multiple IP addresses on one of your interfaces, you
      can use a similar technique -- simplY exclude the smallest network that
      contains all of those addresses from being masqueraded.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename> have no
        effect on which ISP a particular connection will be sent through. That
        is rather the purpose of entries in

        <filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</filename>.</para>
      </warning>
    </section>

    <section id="Martians">
      <title>Martians</title>

      <para>One problem that often arises with Multi-ISP configuration is
      'Martians'. If your Internet interfaces are configured with the
      <emphasis role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> option in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename> (remember that if you set
      that option, you should also select <emphasis
      role="bold">logmartians</emphasis>), then things may not work correctly
      and you will see messages like this:</para>

      <programlisting>Feb  9 17:23:45 gw.ilinx kernel: martian source 206.124.146.176 from 64.86.88.116, on dev eth1 
Feb  9 17:23:45 gw.ilinx kernel: ll header: 00:a0:24:2a:1f:72:00:13:5f:07:97:05:08:00</programlisting>

      <para>The above message is somewhat awkwardly phrased. The source IP in
      this incoming packet was 64.86.88.116 and the destination IP address was
      206.124.146.176. Another gotcha is that the incoming packet has already
      had the destination IP address changed for DNAT or because the original
      outgoing connection was altered by an entry in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename> (SNAT or Masquerade). So the
      destination IP address (206.124.146.176) may not have been the
      destination IP address in the packet as it was initially
      received.</para>

      <para>There a couple of common causes for these problems:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>You have connected both of your external interfaces to the
          same hub/switch. Connecting multiple firewall interfaces to a common
          hub or switch is always a bad idea that will result in
          hard-to-diagnose problems.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You are specifying both the <emphasis
          role="bold">loose</emphasis> and <emphasis
          role="bold">balance</emphasis> options on your provider(s). This can
          cause individual connections to ping-pong back and forth between the
          interfaces which is almost guaranteed to cause problems.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You are redirecting traffic from the firewall system out of
          one interface or the other using packet marking in your
          <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> file. A better approach
          is to configure the application to use the appropriate local IP
          address (the IP address of the interface that you want the
          application to use). See <link linkend="Local">below</link>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If all else fails, remove the <emphasis
      role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> option from your external interfaces.
      If you do this, you may wish to add rules to log and drop packets from
      the Internet that have source addresses in your local networks. For
      example, if the local LAN in the above diagram is 192.168.1.0/24, then
      you would add this rule:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION          SOURCE                     DEST
DROP:info        net:192.168.1.0/24         all</programlisting>

      <para>Be sure the above rule is added before any other rules with
      <emphasis>net</emphasis> in the SOURCE column.</para>

      <para>Experience has shown that in some cases, problems occur with

      when you have specified <emphasis role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> on
      your external interfaces in /etc/shorewall/interfaces (see <link

      <title>USE_DEFAULT_RT</title>

      <para>USE_DEFAULT_RT is an option in <ulink
      url="manpages/shorewall.conf.html">shorewall.conf</ulink> (5).</para>

      <para>One of the drawbacks of the Multi-ISP support as described in the
      preceding sections is that changes to the main table made by
      applications are not added to the individual provider tables. This makes
      route rules such as described in <link linkend="Openvpn">one of the
      examples above</link> necessary.</para>

      <para>USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes works around that problem by passing packets
      through the main table first rather than last. This has a number of
      implications:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Both the DUPLICATE and the COPY columns in the providers file
          must remain empty or contain "-". The individual provider routing
          tables generated when USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes contain only a host route
          to the gateway and a default route via the gateway.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis> option is assumed
          for all interfaces that do not have the <emphasis
          role="bold">loose</emphasis> option. When you want both <emphasis
          role="bold">balance</emphasis> and <emphasis
          role="bold">loose</emphasis>, both must be specified.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The default route generated by Shorewall is added to the
          <emphasis>default</emphasis> routing table (253) rather than to the

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Packets are sent through the main routing table by a routing
          rule with priority 999. The priority range 1-998 may be used for
          inserting rules that bypass the main table.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You should disable all default route management outside of
          Shorewall. If a default route is inadvertently added to the main
          table while Shorewall is started, then all policy routing will stop
          working except for those routing rules in the priority range
          1-998.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>For ppp interfaces, the GATEWAY may remain unspecified ("-").
          For those interfaces managed by dhcpcd or dhclient, you may specify
          'detect' in the GATEWAY column; Shorewall will use the dhcp client's
          database to determine the gateway IP address. All other interfaces
          must have a GATEWAY specified explicitly.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Although 'balance' is automatically assumed when
      USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes, you can easily cause all traffic to use one provider
      except when you explicitly direct it to use the other provider via
      <ulink

      <para>Tuomo Soini describes the following issue when using
      USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes.</para>

      <para>He has a /27 network (let.s call it 70.90.191.0/27) from his
      primary ISP and his secondary ISP supplies him with a dynamic IP address
      on the 91.156.0.0/19 network. From the output of <command>shorewall show
      routing</command>:</para>

      <programlisting>999:    from all lookup main 
10000:  from all fwmark 0x100 lookup ISP1 
10001:  from all fwmark 0x200 lookup ISP2</programlisting>

      <para>Note that the main routing table is consulted prior to the marks
      for his two provlders. When clients in the large /19 network connected
      to his /27 (through ISP1), the responses were routed out of the ISP2
      interface because the main routing table included a route to the
      /19.</para>

      <para>The solution was to add an additional entry to route_rules:</para>

      <programlisting>#SOURCE             DEST           PROVIDER       PRIORITY

      <para>With this additional entry, the routing rules are as below and
      traffic from the /27 is returned via ISP1.</para>

      <programlisting>900:    from 70.90.191.0/27 to 91.156.0.0/19 lookup ISP1

      <title>Gateway Monitoring and Failover</title>

      <para>There are a couple of options available for monitoring the status
      of provider links and taking action when a failure occurs. Both of these
      options assume that each provider has a unique nexthop gateway; if two

        <title>SWPING</title>

        <para>Shorewall includes a sample monitoring script
        <filename>swping</filename>. The <filename>swping</filename> file is
        available in the main directory contained in the Shorewall-common
        tarball and is included in the Shorewall-common documentation
        directory in the Shorewall-common RPM. The script is inspired by
        Angsuman Chakraborty's <ulink
        url="http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/how-to-load-balancing-failover-with-dual-multi-wan-adsl-cable-connections-on-linux/">gwping</ulink>
        script.</para>

        <important>
          <para>These samples are offered <emphasis>as is</emphasis> — they
          work for me but I don't make any claim that they will work for
          anyone else. But if you have a need for automated link monitoring,
          they offer you a place to start.</para>
        </important>

        <important>
          <para>If you have installed Shorewall-init, you should disable its
          ifup/ifdown/NetworkManager integration (set IFUPDOWN=0 in the <ulink
          url="Manpages/shorewall-init.html">Shorewall-init configuration
          file</ulink>).</para>
        </important>

        <para>The script should be copied to a directory on root's PATH such
        as <filename>/usr/local/sbin/</filename>.</para>

        <para>The script works by sending pings to <emphasis>target</emphasis>
        IP addresses through each external interface. These targets must not
        depend on any routes other than those that are present in the main
        routing table. That ensures that a route is available to the target
        even when the target's interface is not working and Shorewall has
        omitted it from the routing configuration. An interface is assumed to
        be <firstterm>up</firstterm> when a specified number (UP_COUNT) of
        consecutive ping operations succeed. Similarly, an interface is
        assumed to be <firstterm>down</firstterm> when a specified number
        (DOWN_COUNT) of consecutive ping operations fail. You can specify the
        interval between pings (PING_INTERVAL).</para>

        <para>The script monitors two interfaces but it is a trivial exercise
        to extend it to more than two. At the top are a number of variables to
        set:</para>

        <programlisting>#
# IP family -- 4 or 6
#

#
# The commands to run when the status of a line changes. Multiple commands may be specified 
# when separated by semicolons (";")

#
# Interfaces to monitor -- you may use shell variables from your params file
#
IF1=eth0
IF2=eth1
#
# Sites to Ping. Must depend only on routes in the 'main' routing table. If not specified,
# the interface is assumed to be managed by dhcpcd and the script uses the gateway address
# from /var/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-${IFx}.info
#

TARGET2=
#
# How often to ping
#
PING_INTERVAL=5

# This many successive pings must succeed for the interface to be marked up when it is down
#
UP_COUNT=5
#
# This many successive pings must fail for the interface to be marked down when it is up
#
DOWN_COUNT=2</programlisting>

        <para>If you leave COMMAND empty, the script sets its value
        automatically depending on whether Shorewall-lite is installed.</para>

        <para>Also included is a sample init script

        <para>As an alternative to using the init script, you can add the

        <para>The sample <filename>lsm.conf</filename> included with the

        configuration file.</para>

        <para>LSM monitors the status of the links defined in its
        configuration file and runs a user-provided script when the status of
        a link changes. The script name is specified in the

      <title>Two Providers Sharing an Interface</title>

      <para>Shared interface support has the following characteristics:</para>

      <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>
          <para>Only Ethernet (or Ethernet-like) interfaces can be used. For
          inbound traffic, the MAC addresses of the gateway routers are used
          to determine which provider a packet was received through. Note that

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must specify the address on the interface that corresponds
          to a particular provider in the INTERFACE column by following the
          interface name with a colon (":") and the address.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename> must be
          qualified by the provider name (or number).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>This feature requires Realm Match support in your kernel and
          iptables.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must add route_rules entries for networks that are
          accessed through a particular provider.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you have additional IP addresses through either provider,
          you must add <filename>route_rules</filename> to direct traffic FROM
          each of those addresses through the appropriate provider.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must manually add MARK rules for traffic known to come
          from each provider.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must specify a gateway IP address in the GATEWAY column
          of<filename> /etc/shorewall/providers</filename>; <emphasis
          role="bold">detect</emphasis> is not permitted.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Taken together, b. and h. effectively preclude using this
      technique with dynamic IP addresses.</para>

      <para>Example:</para>

      <para>This is our home network circa fall 2008. We have two Internet
      providers:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Comcast -- Cable modem with one dynamic IP address.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Avvanta -- ADSL with 5 static IP addresses.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Because the old <trademark>Compaq</trademark>
      <trademark>Presario</trademark> that I use for a firewall only has three
      PCI slots and no onboard Ethernet, it doesn't have enough Ethernet
      controllers to support both providers. So I use a Linksys WRT300n pre-N
      router as a gateway to Comcast. Note that because the Comcast IP address
      is dynamic, I could not share a single firewall interface between the
      two providers directly.</para>

      <para>On my personal laptop (ursa), I have 9 virtual machines running
      various Linux distributions. <emphasis>It is the Shorewall configuration
      on ursa that I will describe here</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Below is a diagram of our network:<graphic align="center"
      fileref="images/Network2008a.png" /></para>

      <para>The local wired network in my office is connected to both gateways
      and uses the private (RFC 1918) network 172.20.1.0/24. The Comcast
      gateway has local IP address 172.20.1.1 while the Avvanta gateway has
      local IP address 172.20.1.254. Ursa's eth0 interface has a single IP
      address (172.20.1.130).</para>

      <para>This configuration uses USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes in
      <filename>shorewall.conf </filename>(see <link
      linkend="USE_DEFAULT_RT">above</link>).</para>

      <para>Here is the <filename>providers</filename> file:</para>

      <para>Several things to note:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>172.20.1.130 is specified as the <filename

          providers.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Both wired providers have the <emphasis
          role="bold">loose</emphasis> option. This prevents Shorewall from
          automatically generating routing rules based on the source IP
          address.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Only <emphasis role="bold">comcast</emphasis> has the
          <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis> option. With
          USE_DEFAULT_RT=yes, that means that <emphasis
          role="bold">comcast</emphasis> will be the default provider. While
          <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis> is the default, with
          USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes, it must be specified explicitly when <emphasis
          role="bold">loose</emphasis> is also specified.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>I always disable the <emphasis role="bold">wireless</emphasis>
          interface when the laptop is connected to the wired network.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>I use a different Shorewall configuration when I take the
          laptop on the road.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Here is the route_rules file:<programlisting>#SOURCE                 DEST                    PROVIDER        PRIORITY

      <para>Those rules direct traffic to the five static Avvanta IP addresses

    <para>This section describes the network at shorewall.net early in 2009.
    The configuration is as follows:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Two providers:</para>

          <listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Comcast -- A fast (20mb/10mb) Cable circuit with a single
            <emphasis>dynamic</emphasis> address.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A local network consisting of wired and wireless client systems.
        A Linksys WRT300N wireless router is used as an access point for the
        wireless hosts.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A DMZ hosting a single server (lists.shorewall.net aka
        www1.shorewall.net, ftp1.shorewall.net,etc.)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The network is pictured in the following diagram:</para>

    <graphic align="center" fileref="images/Network2009.png" />

    <para>Because of the speed of the cable provider, all traffic uses that
    provider unless there is a specific need for the traffic to use the DSL
    line.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Responses to connections from the Internet to one of the DSL IP
        addresses -- the <emphasis role="bold">track</emphasis> option takes
        care of that.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Connections initiated by the server and connections requested by
        clients on the firewall that have bound their local socket to one of
        the DSL IP addresses. Two entries in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</filename> take care of that
        traffic.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>As a consequence, I have disabled all route filtering on the
    firewall and only use the <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis> option
    in <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename> on the Comcast provider
    whose default route in the main table is established by DHCP. By
    specifying the <emphasis role="bold">fallback</emphasis> option on
    Avvanta, I ensure that there is still a default route if Comcast is down.
    <link linkend="lsm">lsm</link> is used to monitor the links.</para>

    <para><filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0</programlisting>

    <para><filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>ROUTE_FILTER=No
RESTORE_DEFAULT_ROUTE=No</programlisting>

    <para>RESTORE_DEFAULT_ROUTE=No causes the default route in the main table
    to be deleted when the Comcast link is unavailable. That way, the default
    route in the default table will be used until Comcast is available
    again.</para>

    <para><filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#NAME  NUMBER MARK  DUPLICATE INTERFACE GATEWAY         OPTIONS                 COPY

#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES ABOVE THIS LINE -- DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">loose</emphasis> option on Avvanta results
    in fewer routing rules. The first two routing rules below insure that all
    traffic from Avvanta-assigned IP addresses is sent via the Avvanta
    provider. The 'tun*' included in the COPY column is there because I run a
    routed OpenVPN server on the firewall.</para>

    <para><filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#SOURCE            DEST           PROVIDER PRIORITY

    <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules </filename>entries provide
    all of the provider selection necessary so my
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> file is used exclusively for
    traffic shaping of the Avvanta line. Note that I still need to provide
    values in the MARK colum of <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename>
    because I specify <emphasis role="bold">track</emphasis> on both
    providers.</para>
