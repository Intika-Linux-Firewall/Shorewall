    <para>Make sure you are<emphasis role="bold"> running a current,

    <para>Reading just Shorewall documentation is probably not going to give
    you enough background to use this material. Shorewall may make iptables
    easy but the Shorewall team doesn't have the resources to be able to
    spoon-feed Linux policy routing to you (please remember that the user's
    manual for a tractor doesn't teach you to grow corn either). You will
    likely need to refer to the following additional information:</para>

    <title>Multiple Internet Connection Support</title>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall 2.3.2, limited support is included for
    multiple internet connections. Limitations of this support are as
    follows:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>It utilizes static routing configuration. As such, there is no
        provision for reacting to the failure of either of the uplinks.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The routing changes are made and the route cache is purged when
        Shorewall is started <emphasis role="bold">and when Shorewall is
        restarted</emphasis> (unless you specify the "-n" option to
        <command>shorewall restart</command>). Ideally, restarting the packet
        filter should have no effect on routing.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Prior to Shorewall 3.4.0, the routes and route rules added by
        this support were not completely removed during <command>shorewall
        stop</command>, <command>shorewall clear</command> or
        <command>shorewall restart</command>.</para>

    <section id="Overview">
      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>Let's assume that a firewall is connected via two separate
      ethernet interfaces to two different ISPs as in the following
      diagram.</para>

      <graphic align="center" fileref="images/TwoISPs.png" valign="middle" />

        <listitem>
          <para>eth0 connects to ISP1. The IP address of eth0 is
          206.124.146.176 and the ISP's gateway router has IP address
          206.124.146.254.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>eth1 connects to ISP 2. The IP address of eth1 is
          130.252.99.27 and the ISP's gateway router has IP address
          130.252.99.254.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>eth2 connects to the local LAN. Its IP configuration is not
          relevant to this discussion.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Each of these <firstterm>providers</firstterm> is described in an
      entry in the file <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename>.</para>

      <para>Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename> can
      specify that outgoing connections are to be load-balanced between the
      two ISPs. Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> can be
      used to direct particular outgoing connections to one ISP or the other.
      Use of <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> is not required for
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename> to work, but you must
      select a unique MARK value for each provider so Shorewall can set up the
      correct marking rules for you.</para>

      <para>When you use the <emphasis role="bold">track</emphasis> option in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename>, connections from the
      internet are automatically routed back out of the correct interface and
      through the correct ISP gateway. This works whether the connection is
      handled by the firewall itself or if it is routed or port-forwarded to a
      system behind the firewall.</para>

      <para>Shorewall will set up the routing and will update the
      <filename>/etc/iproute2/rt_tables</filename> to include the table names
      and numbers of the tables that it adds.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>This feature uses <ulink url="traffic_shaping.htm">packet
        marking</ulink> to control the routing. As a consequence, there are
        some restrictions concerning entries in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename>:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Packet marking for traffic control purposes may not be done
            in the PREROUTING table for connections involving providers with
            'track' specified (see below).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>You may not use the SAVE or RESTORE options.</para>

      </caution>

      <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename> file can also be
      used in other routing scenarios. See the <ulink

                  This means that routes to often-used sites will always be
                  over the same provider.</para>

                  <para>By default, each provider is given the same weight (1)
                  . You can change the weight of a given provider by following
                  <emphasis>balance</emphasis> with "=" and the desired weight
                  (e.g., balance=2). The weights reflect the relative
                  bandwidth of the providers connections and should be small
                  numbers since the kernel actually creates additional default

    <section id="Providers">
      <title>What an entry in the Providers File Does</title>

      <para>Adding another entry in the providers file simply creates an
      alternate routing table for you. The table will usually contain two
      routes:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A host route to the specified GATEWAY through the specified
          INTERFACE.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A default route through the GATEWAY.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Note that the first route is omitted if "-" is specified as the
      GATEWAY; in that case, the default route does not specify a gateway
      (point-to-point link).</para>

      <para>If the DUPLICATE column is non-empty, then routes from the table
      named in that column are copied into the new table. By default, all
      routes (except default routes) are copied. The set of routes copied can
      be restricted using the COPY column which lists the interfaces whose
      routes you want copied. You will generally want to include all local
      interfaces in this list. You should exclude the loopback interface (lo)
      and any interfaces that do not have an IPv4 configuration. You should
      also omit interfaces like <emphasis role="bold">tun</emphasis>
      interfaces that are created dynamically. Traffic to networks handled by
      those intefaces should be routed through the main table using entries in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</filename> (see Example 2 <link
      linkend="Examples">below</link>).</para>

      <para>In addition:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Unless <emphasis role="bold">loose</emphasis> is specified, an
          ip rule is generated for each IP address on the INTERFACE that
          routes traffic from that address through the associated routing
          table.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you specify <emphasis role="bold">track</emphasis>, then
          connections which have had at least one packet arrive on the
          interface listed in the INTERFACE column have their connection mark
          set to the value in the MARK column. In the PREROUTING chain,
          packets with a connection mark have their packet mark set to the
          value of the associated connection mark; packets marked in this way
          bypass any prerouting rules that you create in
          <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename>. This ensures that
          packets associated with connections from outside are always routed
          out of the correct interface.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you specify <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis>, then
          Shorewall will replace the 'default' route with weight 100 in the
          'main' routing table with a load-balancing route among those
          gateways where <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis> was
          specified. So if you configure default routes, be sure that their
          weight is less than 100 or the route added by Shorewall will not be
          used.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>That's <emphasis role="bold">all</emphasis> that these entries do.
      You still have to follow the principle stated in the <ulink
      url="Shorewall_and_Routing.html">Shorewall Routing
      documentation</ulink>:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Once routing determines where the packet is to go, the
          firewall (Shorewall) determines if the packet is allowed to go
          there.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The bottom line is that if you want traffic to go out through a
      particular provider then you <emphasis>must </emphasis>mark that traffic
      with the provider's MARK value in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> and you must do that marking
      in the PREROUTING chain; or, you must provide the appropriate rules in

            specified for some of the providers) that does not include a

      <title>Martians</title>

      <para>One problem that often arises with Multi-ISP configuration is
      'Martians'. If your internet interfaces are configured with the
      <emphasis role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> option in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename> (remember that if you set
      that option, you should also select <emphasis
      role="bold">logmartians</emphasis>), then things may not work correctly
      and you will see messages like this:</para>

      <programlisting>Feb  9 17:23:45 gw.ilinx kernel: martian source 206.124.146.176 from 64.86.88.116, on dev eth1

      <para>The above message is somewhat awkwardly phrased. The source IP in
      this incoming packet was 64.86.88.116 and the destination IP address is
      206.124.146.176. Another gotcha is that the incoming packet has already
      had the destination IP address changed for DNAT or because the original
      outgoing connection was altered by an entry in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename> (SNAT or Masquerade). So the
      destination IP address (206.124.146.176) may not have been the
      destination IP address in the packet as it was initially
      received.</para>

      <para>There a couple of common causes for these problems:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>You have connected both of your external interfaces to the

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You are specifying both the <emphasis
          role="bold">loose</emphasis> and <emphasis

          causes individual connections to ping-pong back and forth between
          the interfaces which is guaranteed to cause problems.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You are redirecting traffic from the local system out of one
          interface or the other using packet marking in your
          <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> file. A better approach
          is to configure the application to use the appropriate local IP
          address (the IP address of the interface that you want the
          application to use). See <link linkend="Local">below</link>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If all else fails, remove the <emphasis
      role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> option from your external interfaces.
      If you do this, you may wish to add rules to log and drop packets from
      the Internet that have source addresses in your local networks. For
      example, if the local LAN in the above diagram is 192.168.1.0/24, then
      you would add this rule:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION          SOURCE                     DEST
DROP:info        net:192.168.1.0/24         all</programlisting>

      <para>Be sure the above rule is added before any other rules with

      <title>Applications running on the Firewall</title>

      <para>Experience has shown that in some cases, problems occur with
      applications running on the firewall itself. This is especially true
      when you have specified <emphasis role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> on
      your external interfaces in /etc/shorewall/interfaces (see <link
      linkend="Martians">above</link>). When this happens, it is suggested
      that you have the application use specific local IP addresses rather
      than 0.</para>

      <para>Examples:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Squid: In <filename>squid.conf</filename>, set <emphasis
          role="bold">tcp_outgoing_address</emphasis> to the IP address of the
          interface that you want Squid to use.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>In OpenVPN, set <emphasis role="bold">local
          </emphasis>(<emphasis role="bold">--local</emphasis> on the command
          line) to the IP address that you want the server to receive
          connections on.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Note that some traffic originating on the firewall doesn't have a
      SOURCE IP address before routing. At least one Shorewall user reports
      that an entry in <filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</filename> with
      'lo' in the SOURCE column seems to be the most reliable way to direct
      such traffic to a particular ISP.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="route_rules">
      <title>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</title>

      <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</filename> file was added
      in Shorewall version 3.2.0. The <filename>route_rules</filename> file
      allows assigning certain traffic to a particular provider just as
      entries in the <filename>tcrules</filename> file. The difference between
      the two files is that entries in <filename>route_rules</filename> are
      independent of Netfilter.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Prior to Shorewall version 3.4.0, entries in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/route_rules</filename> permanently alter your
        firewall/gateway's routing; that is, the effect of these changes is
        not reversed by <command>shorewall stop</command> or
        <command>shorewall clear</command>. To restore routing to its original
        state, you may have to restart your network. This can usually be done
        by <command>/etc/init.d/network restart</command> or
        <command>/etc/init.d/networking restart</command>. Check your
        distribution's networking documentation.</para>

        <para>Please also see the <link linkend="Undo">warning in the section
        above entitled <emphasis>What an Entry in the Providers File
        Does</emphasis></link>.</para>
      </warning>

      <section id="Routing_rules">
        <title>Routing Rules</title>

        <para>Routing rules are maintained by the Linux kernel and can be
        displayed using the <command>ip rule ls</command> command. When
        routing a packet, the rules are processed in turn until the packet is
        successfully routed.</para>

        <programlisting>gateway:~ # <command>ip rule ls</command>
0:      from all lookup local                &lt;=== Local (to the firewall) IP addresses
10001:  from all fwmark 0x1 lookup Blarg     &lt;=== This and the next rule are generated by the
10002:  from all fwmark 0x2 lookup Comcast        'MARK' values in /etc/shorewall/providers.
20000:  from 206.124.146.176 lookup Blarg    &lt;=== This and the next rule are generated unless
20256:  from 24.12.22.33 lookup Comcast           'loose' is specified; based in the output of 'ip addr ls'

32767:  from all lookup default              &lt;=== This table is usually empty
gateway:~ #</programlisting>

        <para>In the above example, there are two providers: Blarg and Comcast
        with MARK 1 going to Blarg and mark 2 going to Comcast.</para>
