  <important>
    <para>The information in this article is only applicable if you plan to

  <warning>
    <para>This documentation is incomplete regarding using IPSEC and the 2.6
    Kernel. Netfilter currently lacks full support for the 2.6 kernel's
    implementation of IPSEC. Until that implementation is complete, only a
    simple network-network tunnel is described for 2.6.</para>

    <para>UPDATE: Some distributions such as <trademark>SUSE</trademark> are
    now shipping Kernels and iptables with the IPSEC-Netfilter patches and
    policy match support. Check <ulink url="IPSEC-2.6.html">this
    article</ulink> for information concerning this support and
    Shorewall.</para>

    <title>IPSec Gateway on the Firewall System</title>

    <para>Suppose that we have the following situation:</para>

    <graphic fileref="images/TwoNets1.png" />

    <para>We want systems in the 192.168.1.0/24 sub-network to be able to
    communicate with systems in the 10.0.0.0/8 network. We assume that on both
    systems A and B, eth0 is the Internet interface.</para>

    <para>To make this work, we need to do two things:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
      <listitem>
        <para>Open the firewall so that the IPSEC tunnel can be established
        (allow the ESP and AH protocols and UDP Port 500).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Allow traffic through the tunnel.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Opening the firewall for the IPSEC tunnel is accomplished by adding
    an entry to the /etc/shorewall/tunnels file.</para>

    <para>In /etc/shorewall/tunnels on system A, we need the following</para>

    <programlisting>#TYPE      ZONE        GATEWAY          GATEWAY ZONE
ipsec      net         134.28.54.2</programlisting>

    <para>In /etc/shorewall/tunnels on system B, we would have:</para>

    <programlisting>#TYPE      ZONE        GATEWAY          GATEWAY ZONE
ipsec      net         206.161.148.9</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>If either of the endpoints is behind a NAT gateway then the
      tunnels file entry on the <emphasis role="bold">other</emphasis>
      endpoint should specify a tunnel type of ipsecnat rather than ipsec and
      the GATEWAY address should specify the external address of the NAT
      gateway.</para>
    </note>

    <para>You need to define a zone for the remote subnet or include it in
    your local zone. In this example, we'll assume that you have created a
    zone called <quote>vpn</quote> to represent the remote subnet. Note that
    you should define the vpn zone before the net zone.</para>

    <para>/etc/shorewall/zones (both systems):</para>

      <para>Remember the assumption that both systems A and B have eth0 as

    </blockquote>

    <para>You will need to allow traffic between the <quote>vpn</quote> zone
    and the <quote>loc</quote> zone -- if you simply want to admit all traffic
    in both directions, you can use the policy file:</para>

    <para>In /etc/shorewall/tunnels on system A, we need the following</para>

    <programlisting>#TYPE         ZONE         GATEWAY         GATEWAY ZONE

    <para>In /etc/shorewall/tunnels on systems B and C, we would have:</para>

    <note>
      <para>If either of the endpoints is behind a NAT gateway then the
      tunnels file entry on the <emphasis role="bold">other</emphasis>
      endpoint should specify a tunnel type of <emphasis>ipsecnat</emphasis>
      rather than ipsec and the GATEWAY address should specify the external
      address of the NAT gateway.</para>
    </note>

    <para>On each system, we will create a zone to represent the remote
    networks. On System A:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE       TYPE         OPTIONS
vpn1        ipv4
vp2         ipv4</programlisting>

    <para>On systems B and C:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE       TYPE         OPTIONS
vpn         ipv4</programlisting>

    <para>At system A, ipsec0 represents two zones so we have the following in
    /etc/shorewall/interfaces:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE       INTERFACE    BROADCAST       OPTIONS
-           ipsec0</programlisting>

    <para>The /etc/shorewall/hosts file on system A defines the two VPN
    zones:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE       HOSTS                        OPTIONS
vpn1        ipsec0:10.0.0.0/16
vpn2        ipsec0:10.1.0.0/16</programlisting>

    <para>At systems B and C, ipsec0 represents a single zone so we have the
    following in /etc/shorewall/interfaces:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE       INTERFACE       BROADCAST    OPTIONS
vpn         ipsec0</programlisting>

    <para>On systems A, you will need to allow traffic between the
    <quote>vpn1</quote> zone and the <quote>loc</quote> zone as well as
    between <quote>vpn2</quote> and the <quote>loc</quote> zone -- if you
    simply want to admit all traffic in both directions, you can use the
    following policy file entries on all three gateways:</para>

    <programlisting>#SOURCE      DEST       POLICY           LOG LEVEL
loc          vpn1       ACCEPT
vpn1         loc        ACCEPT
loc          vpn2       ACCEPT
vpn2         loc        ACCEPT</programlisting>

    <para>On systems B and C, you will need to allow traffic between the
    <quote>vpn</quote> zone and the <quote>loc</quote> zone -- if you simply

vpn          loc        ACCEPT</programlisting>

    <para>Once you have the Shorewall entries added, restart Shorewall on each
    gateway (type shorewall restart); you are now ready to configure the
    tunnels in <ulink
    url="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Efreeswan/">FreeS/WAN</ulink>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>to allow traffic between the networks attached to systems B and C,
      it is necessary to simply add two additional entries to the
      /etc/shorewall/policy file on system A.</para>

      <programlisting>#SOURCE      DEST       POLICY           LOG LEVEL

    </note>

    <note>
      <para>If you find traffic being rejected/dropped in the OUTPUT chain,
      place the names of the remote VPN zones as a comma-separated list in the
      GATEWAY ZONE column of the /etc/shorewall/tunnels file entry.</para>

      <para>You need to define a zone for the laptop or include it in your

      called <quote>vpn</quote> to represent the remote host.</para>

      <para><note>
          <para>the GATEWAY ZONE column contains the name of the zone

    <title>Dynamic RoadWarrior Zones</title>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall release 1.3.10, you can define multiple VPN
    zones and add and delete remote endpoints dynamically using
    /sbin/shorewall. With Shorewall 2.0.2 Beta 1 and later versions, this
    capability must be enabled by setting DYNAMIC_ZONES=Yes in <ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall.conf.html">shorewall.conf</ulink>.<important>
        <para>DYNAMIC_ZONES=Yes is not supported by Shorewall-perl 4.2.0 or
        later versions. Use <ulink url="ipsets.html#Dynamic">dynamic zones
        defined by ipsets</ulink> instead.</para>
      </important></para>

    <para>In /etc/shorewall/zones:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE       TYPE       OPTIONS
vpn1        ipv4
vpn2        ipv4
vpn3        ipv4</programlisting>

    <para>In /etc/shorewall/tunnels:</para>

    <programlisting>#TYPE       ZONE       GATEWAY         GATEWAY ZONE
ipsec       net        0.0.0.0/0       vpn1,vpn2,vpn3</programlisting>

    <para>When Shorewall is started, the zones vpn[1-3] will all be empty and
    Shorewall will issue warnings to that effect. These warnings may be safely
    ignored. FreeS/Wan may now be configured to have three different Road
    Warrior connections with the choice of connection being based on X-509
    certificates or some other means. Each of these connections will utilize a
    different updown script that adds the remote station to the appropriate
    zone when the connection comes up and that deletes the remote station when
    the connection comes down. For example, when 134.28.54.2 connects for the
    vpn2 zone the <quote>up</quote> part of the script will issue the
    command:</para>

    <programlisting>/sbin/shorewall add ipsec0:134.28.54.2 vpn2</programlisting>

    <para>and the <quote>down</quote> part will:</para>

    <programlisting>/sbin/shorewall delete ipsec0:134.28.54.2 vpn2</programlisting>
