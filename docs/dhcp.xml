  <note>
    <para>For most operations, DHCP software interfaces to the Linux IP stack
    at a level below Netfilter. Hence, Netfilter (and therefore Shorewall)
    cannot be used effectively to police DHCP. The <quote>dhcp</quote>
    interface option described in this article allows for Netfilter to stay
    out of DHCP's way for those operations that can be controlled by Netfilter
    and prevents unwanted logging of DHCP-related traffic by
    Shorewall-generated Netfilter logging rules.</para>

    <title>If you want to Run a DHCP Server on your firewall</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Specify the <quote>dhcp</quote> option on each interface to be
        served by your server in the <filename><ulink

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When starting <quote>dhcpd</quote>, you need to list those
        interfaces on the run line. On a RedHat system, this is done by
        modifying <filename>/etc/sysconfig/dhcpd</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If you set 'ping-check' true in your

        <ulink
        url="manpages/shorewall-interfaces.html"><filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename></ulink>

        firewall system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If you know that the dynamic address is always going to be in
        the same subnet, you can specify the subnet address in the interface's
        entry in the <ulink

      <listitem>
        <para>If you don't know the subnet address in advance, you should

        the <ulink

      <listitem>
        <para>In the event that the subnet address might change while
        Shorewall is started, you need to arrange for a <quote>shorewall
        refresh</quote> command to be executed when a new dynamic IP address
        gets assigned to the interface. Check your DHCP client's
        documentation.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>It is a good idea to <ulink url="ping.html">accept
        'ping'</ulink> on any interface that gets its IP address via DHCP.
        That way, if the DHCP server is configured with 'ping-check' true, you
        won't be blocking its 'ping' requests.</para>
