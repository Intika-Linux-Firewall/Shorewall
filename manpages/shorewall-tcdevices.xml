    <title>Description</title>

    <para>Entries in this file define the bandwidth for interfaces on which
    you want traffic shaping to be enabled.</para>

    <para>If you do not plan to use traffic shaping for a device, don't put it
    in here as it limits the troughput of that device to the limits you set
    here.</para>

    <para>The columns in the file are as follows.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis role="bold">INTERFACES</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Name of interface. Each interface may be listed only once in
          this file. You may NOT specify the name of an alias (e.g., eth0:0)
          here; see http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq18</para>

          <para>You may NOT specify wildcards here, e.g. if you have multiple
          ppp interfaces, you need to put them all in here!</para>

          <para>If the device doesn't exist, a warning message will be issued
          during "shorewall [re]start" and "shorewall refresh" and traffic
          shaping configuration will be skipped for that device.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis role="bold">IN-BANDWIDTH</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The incoming Bandwidth of that interface. Please note that you
          are not able to do traffic shaping on incoming traffic, as the
          traffic is already received before you could do so. But this allows
          you to define the maximum traffic allowed for this interface in
          total, if the rate is exceeded, the packets are dropped. You want
          this mainly if you have a DSL or Cable connection to avoid queuing
          at your providers side.</para>

          <para>If you don't want any traffic to be dropped, set this to a
          value to zero in which case Shorewall will not create an ingress
          qdisc.</para>

          <para>Use kbit or kbps(for Kilobytes per second) for speed, and make
          sure there is NO space between the number and the unit.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis role="bold">OUT-BANDWIDTH</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The outgoing Bandwidth of that interface. This is the maximum
          speed your connection can handle. It is also the speed you can refer
          as "full" if you define the tc classes. Outgoing traffic above this
          rate will be dropped.</para>

          <para>Use kbit or kbps(for Kilobytes per second) for speed, and make
          sure there is NO space between the number and the unit.</para>

          interface for this. The device has an outgoing bandwidth of 500kbit
          and an incoming bandwidth of 6000kbit</para>
