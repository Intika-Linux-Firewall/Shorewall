If your system supports rpm, I recommend that you install the Shorewall
.rpm. If you want to install from the tarball:

o Unpack the tarball
o cd to the shorewall-<version> directory
o If you have an earlier version of Shoreline Firewall installed,see the
  upgrade instructions below
o Type:

	./install.sh

o Edit the configuration files in /etc/shorewall/ to fit your environment.

  To do this, I strongly advise you to follow the instructions at:

      http://www.shorewall.net/shorewall_quickstart_guide.htm

o Start the firewall by typing "shorewall start"
o If the install script was unable to configure Shoreline Firewall to
  start automatically at boot, you will have to used your
  distribution's runlevel editor to configure Shorewall manually.

Upgrade:

o run the install script as described above.
o "shorewall check" and correct any errors found.
o "shorewall restart"
