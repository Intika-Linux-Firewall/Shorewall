- Need to make it possible for a host to have the same $FW name as the zone
  in which it belongs, and have shoregen automatically create appropriate
  rules.

- At the moment, if a fully-expanded policy file (such as is shown 

- Better documentation & samples.  I'm sure there is room for improvement.

- Better rule & policy sanitisation.  Again, there is room for improvement.

- The Makefile could be improved to detect changes in the lower level
  config files and call shoregen automatically when they are out-of-date.
  At the moment, shoregen is so simple (and thus fast) that the amount of
  time that would be saved by a clever Makefile (in comparison to the
  rsync, ssh, and shorewall steps) is probably not worth the trouble to
  code.
