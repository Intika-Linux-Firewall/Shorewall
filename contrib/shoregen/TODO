- Make it possible for a host to have the same $FW name as the zone in
  which it belongs, and have shoregen automatically create appropriate
  rules.

- At the moment, if a fully-expanded policy file (such as is shown 

- Better rule & policy sanitisation.

- Hosts and interfaces could be reduced based on what's used in the policy
  and rules files.

- The Makefile could be improved to detect changes in the lower level
  config files and call shoregen automatically when they are out-of-date.
  At the moment, shoregen is so simple (and thus fast) that the amount of
  time that would be saved by a clever Makefile (in comparison to the
  rsync, ssh, and shorewall steps) is probably not worth the trouble to
  code.

- Automatic generation of firewall hosts & interfaces files.
