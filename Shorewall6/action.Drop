# Shorewall6 version 4 - Drop Action
#
# /usr/share/shorewall6/action.Drop
#
#	The default DROP common rules
#
#	This action is invoked before a DROP policy is enforced. The purpose
#	of the action is:
#
#	a) Avoid logging lots of useless cruft.
#	b) Ensure that 'auth' requests are rejected, even if the policy is
#	   DROP. Otherwise, you may experience problems establishing
#	   connections with servers that use auth.
#	c) Ensure that certain ICMP packets that are necessary for successful
#	   internet operation are always ACCEPTed.
#
# IF YOU ARE HAVING CONNECTION PROBLEMS, CHANGING THIS FILE WON'T HELP!!!!!!!!!
