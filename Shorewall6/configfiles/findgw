# Shorewall6 -- /etc/shorewall6/findgw
#
# The code in this file is executed when Shorewall is trying to detect the
# gateway through an interface in /etc/shorewall6/providers that has GATEWAY
# specified as 'detect'.
#
# The function should echo the IP address of the gateway if it knows what
# it is; the name of the interface is in $1.
#
# See http://shorewall.net/shorewall_extension_scripts.htm for additional
# information.
