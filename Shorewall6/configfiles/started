# Shorewall6 -- /etc/shorewall6/started
#
# Add commands below that you want to be executed after shorewall6 has
# been completely started or restarted. The difference between this
# extension script and /etc/shorewall6/start is that this one is invoked
# after the 'shorewall' chain has been created (thus signaling that the
# firewall is completely up).
#
# This script should not change the firewall configuration directly but
# may do so indirectly by running /sbin/shorewall6 with the 'nolock'
# option.
#
# See http://shorewall.net/shorewall_extension_scripts.htm for additional
# information.
