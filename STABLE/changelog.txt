Changes since 1.3.8

1. DNAT rules that remap a port but leave the IP address unchanged are
   now handled properly.

2. The use of shell variables in the LOG LEVEL or SYNPARMS columns of 
   the policy file now works correctly.

3. Added support for /etc/shorewall/startup_disabled.

4. Added support for DNS names in config files.

5. Don't insist on state NEW for protocols other than tcp, udp and
   icmp. Workaround for conntrack glitches in other protocols.

6. Move 'functions', 'version' and 'firewall' to /usr/lib/shorewall.

7. Fix problems with oddball shells.
