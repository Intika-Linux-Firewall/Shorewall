This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected since version 1.4.6:

1) Tuomo Soini has supplied a correction to a problem that occurs using
   some versions of 'ash'. The symptom is that "shorewall start" fails
   with:

   local: --limit: bad variable name
   iptables v1.2.8: Couldn't load match `-j':/lib/iptables/libipt_-j.so: 
   cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
   Try `iptables -h' or 'iptables --help' for more information.

Migration Issues:

None.

New Features:

None.
