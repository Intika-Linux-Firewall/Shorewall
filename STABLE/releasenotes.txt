This is a minor release of Shorewall which rolls up a number of bug
fixes.

New features include:

1) The new "Shorewall Setup Guide" is included in this release. This
   guide is intended for users who have multiple static external IP
   addresses and for users who what to learn a bit more abound
   Shorewall than is described in the single-address guides.

2) Shorewall now drops non-SYN tcp packets that are not part of an
   established connection. These packets can be optionally logged by
   setting the new LOGNEWNOTSYN variable in shorewall.conf.
