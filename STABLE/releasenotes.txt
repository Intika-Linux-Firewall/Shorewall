This is a minor release of Shorewall.

Problems Corrected:

1) The command "shorewall debug try <directory>" now correctly traces
   the attempt.

2) The INCLUDE directive now works properly in the zones file;
   previously, INCLUDE in that file was ignored.

3) /etc/shorewall/routestopped records with an empty second column are no
   longer ignored.

New Features:

1) The ORIGINAL DEST column in a DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-] rule may now
   contain a list of addresses. If the list begins with "!' then the
   rule will take effect only if the original destination address in
   the connection request does not match any of the addresses listed.
