This is a minor release of Shorewall that has a couple of new features.

New features include:

1) A new 'DNAT-' action has been added for entries in the
   /etc/shorewall/rules file. DNAT- is intended for advanced users who
   wish to minimize the number of rules that connection requests must
   traverse.
   
   A Shorewall DNAT rule actually generates two iptables rules: a
   header rewriting rule in the 'nat' table and an ACCEPT rule in the
   'filter' table. A DNAT- rule only generates the first of these
   rules. This is handy when you have several DNAT rules that would
   generate the same ACCEPT rule.

   Here are three rules from my previous rules file:
   
	DNAT   net  dmz:206.124.146.177 tcp smtp - 206.124.146.178
	DNAT   net  dmz:206.124.146.177 tcp smtp - 206.124.146.179
	ACCEPT net  dmz:206.124.146.177 tcp www,smtp,ftp,...

   These three rules ended up generating _three_ copies of 

	 ACCEPT net  dmz:206.124.146.177 tcp smtp

   By writing the rules this way, I end up with only one copy of the
   ACCEPT rule.

	DNAT-  net  dmz:206.124.146.177 tcp smtp -  206.124.146.178
	DNAT-  net  dmz:206.124.146.177 tcp smtp -  206.124.146.179
	ACCEPT net  dmz:206.124.146.177 tcp www,smtp,ftp,...

2) The 'shorewall check' command now prints out the applicable policy
   between each pair of zones.

3. A new CLEAR_TC option has been added to shorewall.conf. If this
   option is set to 'No' then Shorewall won't clear the current
   traffic control rules during [re]start. This setting is intended
   for use by people that prefer to configure traffic shaping when
   the network interfaces come up rather than when the firewall
   is started. If that is what you want to do, set TC_ENABLED=Yes and
   CLEAR_TC=No and do not supply an /etc/shorewall/tcstart file. That
   way, your traffic shaping rules can still use the 'fwmark'
   classifier based on packet marking defined in /etc/shorewall/tcrules.

4. A new SHARED_DIR variable has been added that allows distribution
   packagers to easily move the shared directory (default
   /usr/lib/shorewall). Users should never have a need to change the
   value of this shorewall.conf setting.
