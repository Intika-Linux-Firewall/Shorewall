This is a minor release of Shorewall.

This release introduces incompatibilities with prior releases. See
http://www.shorewall.net/upgrade_issues.htm.

Changes are:

a) There is now a new NONE policy specifiable in
/etc/shorewall/policy. This policy will cause Shorewall to assume that
there will never be any traffic between the source and destination
zones.

b) Shorewall no longer creates rules to govern traffic from an
interface:subnet to itself.

c) Intra-zone traffic is always accepted now (exception is (b)
 above).. Intrazone policies and rules are no longer allowed.
