# Shorewall 1.4 /etc/shorewall/actions
#
#	This file allows you to define new ACTIONS for use in rules 
#	(/etc/shorewall/rules). You define the iptables rules to
#	be performed in an ACTION in
#	/etc/shorewall/action.<action-name>.
#
#	ACTION names should begin with an upper-case letter to
#	distinguish them from Shorewall-generated chain names and
#	they must need the requirements of a Netfilter chain
#	name.
