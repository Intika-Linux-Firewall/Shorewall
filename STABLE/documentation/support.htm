    example.      It would be like saying that you have three rooms at home, 
   and when you   walk  into one of the rooms, you detect this strange smell. 
    Can anyone tell  you  what that strange smell is?<br>
                 <br>
                 Now, all of us could do some wonderful guessing as to the
 smell    and   even   what's causing it.  You would be absolutely amazed
at the range   and   variety   of smells we could come up with.  Even more
amazing is that   all   of the explanations   for the smells would be completely
plausible."<br>

   Do  not  leave out any information that appears to be correct,  or was 
mentioned    in  a previous post. There have been countless  posts by people

actually   contained  a small error.  We tend to be skeptics where detail

practices    in writing  and formatting your e-mail. Provide details that 
we need if  you  expect good  answers. <em>Exact quoting </em> of error messages, 
log  entries,  command output, and other output is better than a paraphrase

             A growing number of MTAs serving list subscribers are rejecting
  all    HTML  traffic. At least one MTA has gone so far as to blacklist
shorewall.net      "for continuous abuse" because it has been my policy to
allow HTML in  list    posts!!<br>
               <br>
                I think that blocking all HTML is a Draconian way to control
  spam    and  that the ultimate losers here are not the spammers but the
list  subscribers      whose MTAs are bouncing all shorewall.net mail. As
one list  subscriber   wrote  to me privately "These e-mail admin's need
to get a <i>(expletive   deleted)</i>  life instead of trying to rid the
planet of HTML based e-mail".   Nevertheless,  to allow subscribers to receive
list posts as must as possible,   I have now   configured the list server
at shorewall.net to strip all HTML   from outgoing  posts.<br>
