<h3 align="left">Problem Reporting Guideline</h3>
                  
<ul>
          <li>When reporting a problem, give as much information as you can.
  Reports   that say "I tried XYZ and it didn't work" are not at all helpful.</li>
          <li>Please don't describe your environment and then ask us to send
  you             custom configuration files. We're here to answer your questions 
   but we           can't do your job for you.</li>
          <li>Do you see any "Shorewall" messages in     /var/log/messages
 when   you exercise the function that is giving you problems?</li>
          <li>Have you looked at the packet flow with a tool like tcpdump 
    to  try to understand what is going on?</li>
          <li>Have you tried using the diagnostic capabilities of the   
 application    that isn't working? For example, if "ssh" isn't able    
to connect, using    the "-v" option gives you a lot of valuable     diagnostic 
information.</li>
          <li>Please include any of the Shorewall configuration files (especially 
   the    /etc/shorewall/hosts file if you have modified that file) that you
   think are    relevant. If an error occurs when you try to "shorewall start",
   include a    trace (See the <a href="troubleshoot.htm">Troubleshooting</a> 
   section for    instructions).</li>
          <li>The list server limits posts to 120kb so don't post GIFs of 
your             network layout, etc to the Mailing List -- your post will 
be rejected.</li>
               
</ul>
               
<h3>Where to Send your Problem Report or to Ask for Help</h3>
            <b>If you run Shorewall on Mandrake 9.0 </b>-- send your problem
 reports and questions to MandrakeSoft. I ordered a Mandrake 9.0 boxed set
 on October 3, 2002; MandrakeSoft issued a charge against my credit card
on  October 4, 2002 (they are really effecient at that part of the order
process)  and I haven't heard a word from them since (although their news
letters boast  that 9.0 boxed sets have been shipping for the last two weeks).
If they can't  fill my 9.0 order within <u>6 weeks after they have billed
my credit card</u>  then I refuse to spend my free time supporting of their
product for them.<br>
   
<h4>If you run Shorewall under Bering -- <span style="font-weight: 400;">please 
    post your question or problem to the <a
 href="mailto:leaf-user@lists.sourceforge.net">LEAF Users mailing list</a>.</span></h4>
               
<p>Otherwise, please post your question or problem to the <a
 href="mailto:shorewall-users@shorewall.net">Shorewall users mailing list</a>; 
    there are lots of folks there who are willing to help you. Your question/problem 
    description and their responses will be placed in the mailing list archives 
   to  help people who have a similar question or problem in the future.</p>
                                               
<p>I don't look at problems sent to me directly but I try to spend some amount 
    of time each day responding to problems posted on the mailing list.</p>
