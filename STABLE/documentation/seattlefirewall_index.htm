      <h2>Introduction to Shorewall<br>
      </h2>
      <h3>This is the Shorewall 1.4 Web Site</h3>
The information on this site applies only to 1.4.x releases of
Shorewall. For older versions:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>The 1.3 site is <a href="http://www.shorewall.net/1.3"
 target="_top">here.</a></li>
        <li>The 1.2 site is <a href="http://shorewall.net/1.2/"
 target="_top">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Glossary<br>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.netfilter.org">Netfilter</a> - the
packet filter facility built into the 2.4 and later Linux kernels.</li>
        <li>ipchains - the packet filter facility built into the 2.2
Linux kernels. Also the name of the utility program used to configure
and control that facility. Netfilter can be used in ipchains
compatibility mode.<br>
        </li>
        <li>iptables - the utility program used to configure and
control Netfilter. The term 'iptables' is often used to refer to the
combination of iptables+Netfilter (with Netfilter not in ipchains
compatibility mode).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What is Shorewall?<br>
      </h3>
The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as "Shorewall", is
high-level tool for configuring Netfilter. You describe your
firewall/gateway requirements using entries in a set of configuration
files. Shorewall reads those configuration files and with the help of
the iptables utility, Shorewall configures Netfilter to match your
requirements. Shorewall can be used on a dedicated firewall system, a
multi-function gateway/router/server or on a standalone GNU/Linux
system. Shorewall does not use Netfilter's ipchains compatibility mode
and can thus take advantage of Netfilter's connection state tracking
capabilities.<br>
      <br>
Shorewall is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> a
daemon. Once Shorewall has configured Netfilter, it's job is complete
although the <a href="starting_and_stopping_shorewall.htm">/sbin/shorewall
program can be used at any time to monitor the Netfilter firewall</a>.<br>

      <p><b>11/07/2003 - Shorewall 1.4.8</b><b> <img
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 28px; height: 12px;"
 src="images/new10.gif" alt="(New)" title=""></b><b><br>
      <br>
      </b>Problems Corrected since version 1.4.7:<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Tuomo Soini has supplied a correction to a problem that
occurs
using some versions of 'ash'. The symptom is that "shorewall start"
fails with:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; local: --limit: bad variable name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; iptables v1.2.8: Couldn't load match
`-j':/lib/iptables/libipt_-j.so:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Try `iptables -h' or 'iptables --help' for more
information.</li>
        <li>Andres Zhoglo has supplied a correction that avoids trying
to use the multiport match iptables facility on ICMP rules.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Example of rule that previously caused "shorewall start"
to fail:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ACCEPT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loc&nbsp; $FW&nbsp;
icmp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0,8,11,12<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Previously, if the following error message was issued,
Shorewall was left in an inconsistent state.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Error: Unable to determine the routes through interface xxx<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Handling of the LOGUNCLEAN option in shorewall.conf has
been corrected.</li>
        <li>In Shorewall 1.4.2, an optimization was added. This
optimization
involved creating a chain named "&lt;zone&gt;_frwd" for most zones
defined using the /etc/shorewall/hosts file. It has since been
discovered that in many cases these new chains contain redundant rules
and that the "optimization" turns out to be less than optimal. The
implementation has now been corrected.</li>
        <li>When the MARK value in a tcrules entry is followed by ":F"
or
":P", the ":F" or ":P" was previously only applied to the first
Netfilter rule generated by the entry. It is now applied to all entries.</li>
        <li>An incorrect comment concerning Debian's use of the
SYBSYSLOCK option has been removed from shorewall.conf.</li>
        <li>Previously, neither the 'routefilter' interface option nor
the
ROUTE_FILTER parameter were working properly. This has been corrected
(thanks to Eric Bowles for his analysis and patch). The definition of
the ROUTE_FILTER option has changed however. Previously,
ROUTE_FILTER=Yes was documented as enabling route filtering on all
interfaces (which didn't work). Beginning with this release, setting
ROUTE_FILTER=Yes will enable route filtering of all interfaces brought
up while Shorewall is started. As a consequence, ROUTE_FILTER=Yes can
coexist with the use of the 'routefilter' option in the interfaces file.</li>
        <li>If MAC verification was enabled on an interface with a /32
address and
a broadcast address then an error would occur during startup.</li>
        <li>he NONE policy's intended use is to suppress the generating
of
rules that can't possibly be traversed. This means that a policy of
NONE is inappropriate where the source or destination zone is $FW or
"all". Shorewall now generates an error message if such a policy is
given in /etc/shorewall/policy. Previously such a policy caused
"shorewall start" to fail.</li>
        <li>The 'routeback' option was broken for wildcard interfaces
(e.g.,
"tun+"). This has been corrected so that 'routeback' now works as
expected in this case.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
Migration Issues:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>The definition of the ROUTE_FILTER option in shorewall.conf
has changed as described in item 8) above.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
New Features:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>A new QUEUE action has been introduced for rules. QUEUE
allows
you to pass connection requests to a user-space filter such as ftwall
(http://p2pwall.sourceforge.net). The ftwall program
allows for effective filtering of p2p applications such as Kazaa. For
example, to use ftwall to filter P2P clients in the 'loc' zone, you
would add the following rules:<br>
          <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; QUEUE&nbsp;&nbsp; loc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tcp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; QUEUE&nbsp;&nbsp; loc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; udp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; QUEUE&nbsp;&nbsp; loc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fw&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; udp<br>
          <br>
You would normally want to place those three rules BEFORE any ACCEPT
rules for loc-&gt;net udp or tcp.<br>
          <br>
Note: When the protocol specified is TCP ("tcp", "TCP" or "6"),
Shorewall will only pass connection requests (SYN packets) to user
space. This is for compatibility with ftwall.</li>
        <li>A BLACKLISTNEWNONLY option has been added to
shorewall.conf. When this option is set to "Yes", the blacklists
(dynamic and static) are only consulted for new connection requests.
When set to "No" (the default if the variable is not set), the
blacklists are consulted on every packet.<br>
          <br>
Setting this option to "No" allows blacklisting to stop existing
connections from a newly blacklisted host but is more expensive in
terms of packet processing time. This is especially true if the
blacklists contain a large number of entries.</li>
        <li>Chain names used in the /etc/shorewall/accounting file may
now begin with a digit ([0-9]) and may contain embedded dashes ("-").</li>
      </ol>

        <li>The saga with "&lt;zone&gt;_frwd" chains continues. The

      <ol>
        <li>The fix for problem 5 in 1.4.7a was wrong with the result
