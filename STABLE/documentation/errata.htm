<h3>Version 1.3.11a</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="http://www.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/errata/1.3.11/rfc1918">This
copy of /etc/shorewall/rfc1918</a> reflects the recent allocation of 82.0.0.0/8.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.11</h3>
     
<ul>
     <li>When installing/upgrading using the .rpm, you may receive the following 
 warnings:<br>
       <br>
        user teastep does not exist - using root<br>
        group teastep does not exist - using root<br>
       <br>
   These warnings are harmless and may be ignored. Users downloading the
.rpm  from shorewall.net or mirrors should no longer see these warnings as
the .rpm you will get from there has been corrected.</li>
    <li>DNAT rules that exclude a source subzone (SOURCE column contains
!  followed by a sub-zone list) result in an error message and Shorewall
fails  to start.<br>
      <br>
  Install <a
 href="http://www.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/errata/1.3.11/firewall">this
 corrected script</a> in /usr/lib/shorewall/firewall to correct this problem. 
Thanks go to Roger Aich who analyzed this problem and provided a fix.<br>
     <br>
 This problem is corrected in version 1.3.11a.<br>
    </li>
     
</ul>
     
<h3>Version 1.3.10</h3>
         
<ul>
       <li>If you experience problems connecting to a PPTP server running 
on  your firewall and you have a 'pptpserver' entry in /etc/shorewall/tunnels,
      <a
 href="http://www.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/errata/1.3.10/firewall">this
  version of the firewall script</a> may help. Please report any cases where
  installing this script in /usr/lib/shorewall/firewall solved your connection
  problems. Beginning with version 1.3.10, it is safe to save the old version
  of /usr/lib/shorewall/firewall before copying in the new one since /usr/lib/shorewall/firewall
  is the real script now and not just a symbolic link to the real script.<br>
       </li>
         
</ul>
         
<h3>Version 1.3.9a</h3>
           
<ul>
        <li> If entries are used in /etc/shorewall/hosts and MERGE_HOSTS=No 
 then  the following message appears during "shorewall [re]start":</li>

<ul>
        <li>The installer (install.sh) issues a misleading message "Common
 functions   installed in /var/lib/shorewall/functions" whereas the file
is  installed  in /usr/lib/shorewall/functions. The installer also performs
incorrectly  when updating old configurations that had the file /etc/shorewall/functions.

<p>"shorewall refresh" is not creating the proper

<p>If "norfc1918" and "dhcp" are both specified as                      
         options on a given interface then RFC 1918                     
          checking is occurring before DHCP checking. This              
                 means that if a DHCP client broadcasts using an        
                       RFC 1918 source address, then the firewall will  
                             reject the broadcast (usually logging it). This
                                     has two problems:</p>

  to obtain   an IP  address                                  lease from
that   server.</li>
                                             <li>With this order of checking,

<h3><a name="NAT"></a>Problems with RH Kernel 2.4.18-10 and NAT<br>
           </h3>
        /etc/shorewall/nat entries of the following form will result in Shorewall
    being unable to start:<br>
        <br>
               
<pre>#EXTERNAL       INTERFACE       INTERNAL        ALL INTERFACES          LOCAL<br>192.0.2.22      eth0            192.168.9.22    yes                     yes<br>#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES ABOVE THIS LINE -- DO NOT REMOVE</pre>
        Error message is:<br>
               
<pre>Setting up NAT...<br>iptables: Invalid argument<br>Terminated<br><br></pre>
        The solution is to put "no" in the LOCAL column. Kernel support for 
 LOCAL=yes   has never worked properly and 2.4.18-10 has disabled it. The 
2.4.19 kernel   contains corrected support under a new kernel configuraiton 
option; see <a href="Documentation.htm#NAT">http://www.shorewall.net/Documentation.htm#NAT</a><br>
