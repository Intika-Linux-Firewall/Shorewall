      <p>&quot;I just installed Shorewall after weeks of messing with
      ipchains/iptables and I had it up and running in under 20 minutes!&quot;

      <p>&quot;I downloaded Shorewall 1.2.0 and installed it on Mandrake 8.1
      without any problems. Your documentation is great and I really appreciate
      your network configuration info. That really helped me out alot.
      THANKS!!!&quot; -- MM.

      <p>&quot;[Shorewall is a] great, great project. I've used/tested may
      firewall scripts but this one is till now the best.&quot; -- B.R,

      <p>&quot;Never in my +12 year career as a sys admin have I witnessed
      someone so relentless in developing a secure, state of the art, save and
      useful product as the Shorewall firewall package for no cost or obligation
      involved.&quot; -- Mario Kericki, Toronto

      <p>&quot;one time more to report, that your great shorewall in the latest 
      release
      1.2.9 is working fine for me with SuSE Linux 7.3! I now have 7 machines up
      and running with shorewall on several versions - starting with 1.2.2 up to
      the new 1.2.9 and I never have encountered any problems!&quot; -- SM, Germany</p>
                                  
                      
      <p>&quot;You have the best support of any other package I've ever
      used.&quot; -- SE, US

<p>&quot;Because our company has information which has been classified by the 
national government as secret, our security doesn't stop by putting a fence 
around our company. Information security is a hot issue. We also make use of 
checkpoint firewalls, but not all of the internet servers are guarded by 
checkpoint, some of them are running....Shorewall.&quot; -- Name withheld by request,

<p>&quot;thanx for all your efforts you put into shorewall - this product stands out 
against a lot of commercial stuff i´ve been working with in terms of 
flexibillity, quality &amp; support&quot; -- RM, Austria</p>

<p>&quot;I have never seen such a complete firewall package that is so easy to 
configure. I searched the Debian package system for firewall scripts and 
Shorewall won hands down.&quot; -- RG, Toronto</p>

<p>&quot;My respects... I've just found and installed Shorewall 1.3.3-1 and it is a 
wonderful piece of software. I've just sent out an email to about 30 people 
recommending it. :-)<br>
While I had previously taken the time (maybe 40 hours) to really understand 
ipchains, then spent at least an hour per server customizing and carefully 
scrutinizing firewall rules, I've got shorewall running on my home firewall, 
with rulesets and policies that I know make sense, in under 20 minutes.&quot; -- RP,
