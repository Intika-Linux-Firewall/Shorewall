# Shorewall 1.4 -- Proxy ARP
#
# /etc/shorewall/proxyarp
#
#	This file is used to define Proxy ARP.
#
# Columns must be separated by white space and are:
#
#	ADDRESS		IP Address
#	INTERFACE	Local interface where system is connected. If the
#			local interface is obvious from the subnetting,
#			you may enter "-" in this column.
#	EXTERNAL	External Interface to be used to access this system
#
#	HAVEROUTE	If there is already a route from the firewall to
#			the host whose address is given, enter "Yes" or "yes"
#			in this column. Otherwise, entry "no", "No" or leave
#			the column empty.
#
#			Example: Host with IP 155.186.235.6 is connected to
#			interface eth1 and we want hosts attached via eth0
#			to be able to access it using that address.
#
#			#ADDRESS	INTERFACE	EXTERNAL   HAVEROUTE
#			155.186.235.6	eth1		eth0       No
